    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The six tales now translated for the English reader were written by
      Turgenev at various dates between 1847 and 1881. Their chronological order
      is:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pyetushkov</i>, 1847
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Brigadier</i>, 1867
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>A Strange Story</i>, 1869
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Punin and Baburin</i>, 1874
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Old Portraits</i>, 1881
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>A Desperate Character</i>, 1881
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pyetushkov</i> is the work of a young man of twenty-nine, and its
      lively, unstrained realism is so bold, intimate, and delicate as to
      contradict the flattering compliment that the French have paid to one
      another&mdash;that Turgenev had need to dress his art by the aid of French
      mirrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although <i>Pyetushkov</i> shows us, by a certain open <i>naïveté</i> of
      style, that a youthful hand is at work, it is the hand of a young master,
      carrying out the realism of the &lsquo;forties&rsquo;&mdash;that of Gogol, Balzac, and
      Dickens&mdash;straightway, with finer point, to find a perfect equilibrium
      free from any bias or caricature. The whole strength and essence of the
      realistic method has been developed in <i>Pyetushkov</i> to its just
      limits. The Russians are <i>instinctive</i> realists, and carry the warmth
      of life into their pages, which warmth the French seem to lose in
      clarifying their impressions and crystallising them in art. <i>Pyetushkov</i>
      is not exquisite: it is irresistible. Note how the reader is transported
      bodily into Pyetushkov&rsquo;s stuffy room, and how the major fairly boils out
      of the two pages he lives in! (pp. 301, 302). That is <i>realism</i> if
      you like. A woman will see the point of <i>Pyetushkov</i> very quickly.
      Onisim and Vassilissa and the aunt walk and chatter around the stupid
      Pyetushkov, and glance at him significantly in a manner that reveals
      everything about these people&rsquo;s world. All the servants who appear in the
      tales in this volume are hit off so marvellously that one sees the
      lower-class world, which is such a mystery to certain refined minds, has
      no secrets for Turgenev.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a different, and to our taste more fascinating, <i>genre</i> is <i>The
      Brigadier</i>. It is greater art because life&rsquo;s prosaic growth is revealed
      not merely realistically, but also poetically, life as a tiny part of the
      great universe around it. The tale is a microcosm of Turgenev&rsquo;s own
      nature; his love of Nature, his tender sympathy for all humble, ragged,
      eccentric, despised human creatures; his unfaltering keenness of gaze into
      character, his fine sense of proportion, mingle in. <i>The Brigadier</i>,
      to create for us a sense of the pitiableness of man&rsquo;s tiny life, of the
      mere human seed which springs and spreads a while on earth, and dies under
      the menacing gaze of the advancing years. &lsquo;Out of the sweetness came forth
      strength&rsquo; is perhaps the best saying by which one can define Turgenev&rsquo;s
      peculiar merits in <i>The Brigadier</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Punin and Baburin</i> presents to us again one of those ragged ones,
      one of &lsquo;the poor in spirit,&rsquo; the idealist Punin, a character whose
      portrait challenges Dostoievsky&rsquo;s skill on the latter&rsquo;s own ground. That
      delicious Punin! and that terrible grandmother&rsquo;s scene with Baburin! How
      absolutely Slav is the blending of irony and kindness in the treatment of
      Punin, Cucumber, and Pyetushkov, few English readers will understand. All
      the characters in <i>Punin and Baburin</i> are so strongly drawn, so
      intensely alive, that, like Rembrandt&rsquo;s portraits, they make the living
      people, who stand looking at them, absurdly grey and lifeless by
      comparison! Baburin is a Nihilist before the times of Nihilism, he is a
      type of the strong characters that arose later in the movement of the
      &lsquo;eighties.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A pre-Nihilistic type is also the character of Sophie in <i>A Strange
      Story</i>. But the chief value of this last psychological study is that it
      gives the English mind a clue to the fundamental distinction that marks
      off the Russian people from the peoples of the West. Sophie&rsquo;s words&mdash;&lsquo;You
      spoke of the will&mdash;that&rsquo;s what must be broken&rsquo; (p. 61)&mdash;define
      most admirably the deepest aspiration of the Russian soul. To be lowly and
      suffering, to be despised, sick, to be under the lash of fate, to be
      trampled under foot by others, <i>to be</i> unworthy, all this secret
      desire of the Russian soul implies that the Russian has little <i>will</i>,
      that he finds it easier to resign himself than to make the effort to be
      powerful, triumphant, worthy. It is from the resignation and softness of
      the Russian nature that all its characteristic virtues spring. Whereas
      religion with the English mind is largely an anxiety to be moral, to be <i>right</i>
      and righteous, to be &lsquo;a chosen vessel of the Lord,&rsquo; religion with the
      Russian implies a genuine abasement and loss of self, a bowing before the
      will of Heaven, and true brotherly love. The Western mind rises to
      greatness by concentrating the will-power in action, by assertion of all
      its inner force, by shutting out forcibly whatever might dominate or
      distract or weaken it. But the Russian mind, through its lack of
      character, will-power, and hardness, rises to greatness in its acceptance
      of life, and in its sympathy with all the unfortunate, the wretched, the
      poor in spirit. Of course in practical life the Russian lacks many of the
      useful virtues the Western peoples possess and has most of their vices;
      but certainly his pity, charity, and brotherliness towards men more
      unfortunate than himself largely spring from his fatalistic acceptance of
      his own unworthiness and weakness. So in Sophie&rsquo;s case the desire for
      self-sacrifice, and her impregnable conviction that to suffer and endure
      is <i>right</i>, is truly Russian in the sense of letting the
      individuality go <i>with</i> the stream of fate, not <i>against</i> it.
      And hence the formidable spirit of the youthful generation that sacrificed
      itself in the Nihilistic movement: the strenuous action of &lsquo;the youth&rsquo; 
      once set in movement, the spirit of self-sacrifice impelled it calmly
      towards its goal despite all the forces and threats of fate. Sophie is
      indeed an early Nihilist born before her time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have said that the lack of will in the Russian nature is at the root of
      Russian virtues and vices, and in this connection it is curious to remark
      that a race&rsquo;s soul seems often to grow out of the race&rsquo;s <i>aspiration
      towards what it is not in life</i>. Is not the French intellect, for
      example, so cool, clear-headed, so delicately analytic of its own motives,
      that through the principle of <i>counterpoise</i> it strives to lose
      itself and release itself in continual rhetoric and emotional positions?
      Is not the German mind so alive to the material facts of life, to the
      necessity of getting hold of concrete advantages in life, and of not
      letting them go, that it deliberately slackens the bent bow, and plunges
      itself and relaxes itself in floods of abstractions, and idealisations,
      and dreams of sentimentality? Assuredly it is because the Russian is so
      inwardly discontented with his own actions that he is such a keen and
      incisive critic of everything <i>false</i> and exaggerated, that he
      despises all French rhetoric and German sentimentalism. And in this sense
      it is that the Russian&rsquo;s lack of will comes in to deepen his soul. He
      surrenders himself thereby to the universe, and, as do the Asiatics, does
      not let the tiny shadow of his fate, dark though it may be, shut out the
      universe so thoroughly from his consciousness, as does the aggressive
      struggling will-power of the Western man striving to let his individuality
      have full play. The Russian&rsquo;s attitude may indeed be compared to a bowl
      which catches and sustains what life brings it; and the Western man&rsquo;s to a
      bowl inverted to ward off what drops from the impassive skies. The mental
      attitude of the Russian peasant indeed implies that in blood he is nearer
      akin to the Asiatics than Russian ethnologists have wished to allow.
      Certainly in the inner life of thought, intellectually, morally, and
      emotionally, he is a half-way house between the Western and Eastern races,
      just as geographically he spreads over the two continents. By natural law
      his destiny calls him towards the East. Should he one day spread his rule
      further and further among the Asiatics and hold the keys of an immense
      Asiatic empire, well! future English philosophers may feel thereat a
      curious fatalistic satisfaction.

    <p>
      ... We were a party of eight in the room, and we were talking of
      contemporary affairs and men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand these men!&rsquo; observed A.: &lsquo;they&rsquo;re such desperate
      fellows.... Really desperate.... There has never been anything like it
      before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, there has,&rsquo; put in P., a man getting on in years, with grey hair,
      born some time in the twenties of this century: &lsquo;there were desperate
      characters in former days too, only they were not like the desperate
      fellows of to-day. Of the poet Yazikov some one has said that he had
      enthusiasm, but not applied to anything&mdash;an enthusiasm without an
      object. So it was with those people&mdash;their desperateness was without
      an object. But there, if you&rsquo;ll allow me, I&rsquo;ll tell you the story of my
      nephew, or rather cousin, Misha Poltyev. It may serve as an example of the
      desperate characters of those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came into God&rsquo;s world, I remember, in 1828, at his father&rsquo;s native
      place and property, in one of the sleepiest corners of a sleepy province
      of the steppes. Misha&rsquo;s father, Andrei Nikolaevitch Poltyev, I remember
      well to this day. He was a genuine old-world landowner, a God-fearing,
      sedate man, fairly&mdash;for those days&mdash;well educated, just a little
      cracked, to tell the truth&mdash;and, moreover, he suffered from
      epilepsy.... That too is an old-world, gentlemanly complaint.... Andrei
      Nikolaevitch&rsquo;s fits were, however, slight, and generally ended in sleep
      and depression. He was good-hearted, and of an affable demeanour, not
      without a certain stateliness: I always pictured to myself the tsar Mihail
      Fedorovitch as like him. The whole life of Andrei Nikolaevitch was passed
      in the punctual fulfilment of every observance established from old days,
      in strict conformity with all the usages of the old orthodox holy Russian
      mode of life. He got up and went to bed, ate his meals, and went to his
      bath, rejoiced or was wroth (both very rarely, it is true), even smoked
      his pipe and played cards (two great innovations!), not after his own
      fancy, not in a way of his own, but according to the custom and ordinance
      of his fathers&mdash;with due decorum and formality. He was tall, well
      built, and stout; his voice was soft and rather husky, as is so often the
      case with virtuous people in Russia; he was scrupulously neat in his dress
      and linen, and wore white cravats and full-skirted snuff-coloured coats,
      but his noble blood was nevertheless evident; no one could have taken him
      for a priest&rsquo;s son or a merchant! At all times, on all possible occasions,
      and in all possible contingencies, Andrei Nikolaevitch knew without fail
      what ought to be done, what was to be said, and precisely what expressions
      were to be used; he knew when he ought to take medicine, and just what he
      ought to take; what omens were to be believed and what might be
      disregarded ... in fact, he knew everything that ought to be done.... For
      as everything had been provided for and laid down by one&rsquo;s elders, one had
      only to be sure not to imagine anything of one&rsquo;s self.... And above all,
      without God&rsquo;s blessing not a step to be taken!&mdash;It must be confessed
      that a deadly dulness reigned supreme in his house, in those low-pitched,
      warm, dark rooms, that so often resounded with the singing of liturgies
      and all-night services, and had the smell of incense and Lenten dishes
      almost always hanging about them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrei Nikolaevitch&mdash;no longer in his first youth&mdash;married a
      young lady of a neighbouring family, without fortune, a very nervous and
      sickly person, who had had a boarding-school education. She played the
      piano fairly, spoke boarding-school French, was easily moved to
      enthusiasm, and still more easily to melancholy and even tears.... She was
      of unbalanced character, in fact. She regarded her life as wasted, could
      not care for her husband, who, &lsquo;of course,&rsquo; did not understand her; but
      she respected him, ... she put up with him; and being perfectly honest and
      perfectly cold, she never even dreamed of another &lsquo;affection.&rsquo; Besides,
      she was always completely engrossed in the care, first, of her own really
      delicate health, secondly, of the health of her husband, whose fits always
      inspired in her something like superstitious horror, and lastly, of her
      only son, Misha, whom she brought up herself with great zeal. Andrei
      Nikolaevitch did not oppose his wife&rsquo;s looking after Misha, on the one
      condition of his education never over-stepping the lines laid down, once
      and for all, within which everything must move in his house! Thus, for
      instance, at Christmas-time, and at New Year, and St. Vassily&rsquo;s eve, it
      was permissible for Misha to dress up and masquerade with the servant boys&mdash;and
      not only permissible, but even a binding duty.... But, at any other time,
      God forbid! and so on, and so on.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      I remember Misha at thirteen. He was a very pretty boy, with rosy little
      cheeks and soft lips (indeed he was soft and plump-looking all over), with
      prominent liquid eyes, carefully brushed and combed, caressing and modest&mdash;a
      regular little girl! There was only one thing about him I did not like: he
      rarely laughed; but when he did laugh, his teeth&mdash;large white teeth,
      pointed like an animal&rsquo;s&mdash;showed disagreeably, and the laugh itself
      had an abrupt, even savage, almost animal sound, and there were unpleasant
      gleams in his eyes. His mother was always praising him for being so
      obedient and well behaved, and not caring to make friends with rude boys,
      but always preferring feminine society. &lsquo;A mother&rsquo;s darling, a milksop,&rsquo; 
      his father, Andrei Nikolaevitch, would call him; &lsquo;but he&rsquo;s always ready to
      go into the house of God.... And that I am glad to see.&rsquo; Only one old
      neighbour, who had been a police captain, once said before me, speaking of
      Misha, &lsquo;Mark my words, he&rsquo;ll be a rebel.&rsquo; And this saying, I remember,
      surprised me very much at the time. The old police captain, it is true,
      used to see rebels on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just such an exemplary youth Misha continued to be till the eighteenth
      year of his age, up to the death of his parents, both of whom he lost
      almost on the same day. As I was all the while living constantly at
      Moscow, I heard nothing of my young kinsman. An acquaintance coming from
      his province did, it is true, inform me that Misha had sold the paternal
      estate for a trifling sum; but this piece of news struck me as too wildly
      improbable! And behold, all of a sudden, one autumn morning there flew
      into the courtyard of my house a carriage, with a pair of splendid
      trotting horses, and a coachman of monstrous size on the box; and in the
      carriage, wrapped in a cloak of military cut, with a beaver collar two
      yards deep, and with a foraging cap cocked on one side, <i>à la diable
      m&rsquo;emporte</i>, sat ... Misha! On catching sight of me (I was standing at
      the drawing-room window, gazing in astonishment at the flying equipage),
      he laughed his abrupt laugh, and jauntily flinging back his cloak, he
      jumped out of the carriage and ran into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Misha! Mihail Andreevitch!&rsquo; I was beginning, ... &lsquo;Is it you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call me Misha,&rsquo;&mdash;he interrupted me. &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s I, ... I, in my own
      person.... I have come to Moscow ... to see the world ... and show myself.
      And here I am, come to see you. What do you say to my horses?... Eh?&rsquo; he
      laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it was seven years since I had seen Misha last, I recognised him at
      once. His face had remained just as youthful and as pretty as ever&mdash;there
      was no moustache even visible; only his cheeks looked a little swollen
      under his eyes, and a smell of spirits came from his lips. &lsquo;Have you been
      long in Moscow?&rsquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I supposed you were at home in the country, looking after the place.&rsquo; ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh! The country I threw up at once! As soon as my parents died&mdash;may
      their souls rest in peace&mdash;(Misha crossed himself scrupulously,
      without a shade of mockery) at once, without a moment&rsquo;s delay, ... <i>ein,
      zwei, drei!</i> ha, ha! I let it go cheap, damn it! A rascally fellow
      turned up. But it&rsquo;s no matter! Anyway, I am living as I fancy, and amusing
      other people. But why are you staring at me like that? Was I, really, to
      go dragging on in the same old round, do you suppose? ... My dear fellow,
      couldn&rsquo;t I have a glass of something?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Misha spoke fearfully quick and hurriedly, and, at the same time, as
      though he were only just waked up from sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Misha, upon my word!&rsquo; I wailed; &lsquo;have you no fear of God? What do you
      look like? What an attire! And you ask for a glass too! And to sell such a
      fine estate for next to nothing....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God I fear always, and do not forget,&rsquo; he broke in.... &lsquo;But He is good,
      you know&mdash;God is.... He will forgive! And I am good too.... I have
      never yet hurt any one in my life. And drink is good too; and as for
      hurting,... it never hurt any one either. And my get-up is quite the most
      correct thing.... Uncle, would you like me to show you I can walk
      straight? Or to do a little dance?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, spare me, please! A dance, indeed! You&rsquo;d better sit down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As to that, I&rsquo;ll sit down with pleasure.... But why do you say nothing of
      my greys? Just look at them, they&rsquo;re perfect lions! I&rsquo;ve got them on hire
      for the time, but I shall buy them for certain, ... and the coachman
      too.... It&rsquo;s ever so much cheaper to have one&rsquo;s own horses. And I had the
      money, but I lost it yesterday at faro. It&rsquo;s no matter, I&rsquo;ll make it up
      to-morrow. Uncle, ... how about that little glass?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still unable to get over my amazement. &lsquo;Really, Misha, how old are
      you? You ought not to be thinking about horses or cards, ... but going
      into the university or the service.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Misha first laughed again, then gave vent to a prolonged whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, uncle, I see you&rsquo;re in a melancholy humour to-day. I&rsquo;ll come back
      another time. But I tell you what: you come in the evening to Sokolniki.
      I&rsquo;ve a tent pitched there. The gypsies sing, ... such goings-on.... And
      there&rsquo;s a streamer on the tent, and on the streamer, written in large
      letters: &ldquo;The Troupe of Poltyev&rsquo;s Gypsies.&rdquo; The streamer coils like a
      snake, the letters are of gold, attractive for every one to read. A free
      entertainment&mdash;whoever likes to come! ... No refusal! I&rsquo;m making the
      dust fly in Moscow ... to my glory! ... Eh? will you come? Ah, I&rsquo;ve one
      girl there ... a serpent! Black as your boot, spiteful as a dog, and eyes
      ... like living coals! One can never tell what she&rsquo;s going to do&mdash;kiss
      or bite! ... Will you come, uncle? ... Well, good-bye, till we meet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a sudden embrace, and a smacking kiss on my shoulder, Misha
      darted away into the courtyard, and into the carriage, waved his cap over
      his head, hallooed,&mdash;the monstrous coachman leered at him over his
      beard, the greys dashed off, and all vanished!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I&mdash;like a sinner&mdash;set off to Sokolniki, and did
      actually see the tent with the streamer and the inscription. The drapery
      of the tent was raised; from it came clamour, creaking, and shouting.
      Crowds of people were thronging round it. On a carpet spread on the ground
      sat gypsies, men and women, singing and beating drums, and in the midst of
      them, in a red silk shirt and velvet breeches, was Misha, holding a
      guitar, dancing a jig. &lsquo;Gentlemen! honoured friends! walk in, please! the
      performance is just beginning! Free to all!&rsquo; he was shouting in a high,
      cracked voice. &lsquo;Hey! champagne! pop! a pop on the head! pop up to the
      ceiling! Ha! you rogue there, Paul de Kock!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily he did not see me, and I hastily made off.
    </p>
    <p>
      I won&rsquo;t enlarge on my astonishment at the spectacle of this
      transformation. But, how was it actually possible for that quiet and
      modest boy to change all at once into a drunken buffoon? Could it all have
      been latent in him from childhood, and have come to the surface directly
      the yoke of his parents&rsquo; control was removed? But that he had made the
      dust fly in Moscow, as he expressed it&mdash;of that, certainly, there
      could be no doubt. I have seen something of riotous living in my day; but
      in this there was a sort of violence, a sort of frenzy of
      self-destruction, a sort of desperation!

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      For two months these diversions continued.... And once more I was standing
      at my drawing-room window, looking into the courtyard.... All of a sudden&mdash;what
      could it mean? ... there came slowly stepping in at the gate a pilgrim ...
      a squash hat pulled down on his forehead, his hair combed out straight to
      right and left below it, a long gown, a leather belt ... Could it be
      Misha? He it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to meet him on the steps.... &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this masquerade for?&rsquo; I
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not a masquerade, uncle,&rsquo; Misha answered with a deep sigh: since all
      I had I&rsquo;ve squandered to the last farthing&mdash;and a great repentance
      too has come upon me&mdash;so I have resolved to go to the Sergiev
      monastery of the Holy Trinity to expiate my sins in prayer. For what
      refuge was left me? ... And so I have come to you to say good-bye, uncle,
      like a prodigal son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked intently at Misha. His face was just the same, rosy and fresh
      (indeed it remained almost unchanged to the end), and the eyes, liquid,
      affectionate, and languishing&mdash;and the hands, as small and white....
      But he smelt of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I pronounced at last, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a good thing to do&mdash;since there&rsquo;s
      nothing else to be done. But why is it you smell of spirits?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A relic of the past,&rsquo; answered Misha, and he suddenly laughed, but
      immediately pulled himself up, and, making a straight, low bow&mdash;a
      monk&rsquo;s bow&mdash;he added: &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you help me on my way? I&rsquo;m going, see,
      on foot to the monastery....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-day ... at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why be in such a hurry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle, my motto always was, &ldquo;Make haste, make haste!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what is your motto now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the same now.... Only, make haste towards <i>good</i>!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Misha went off, leaving me to ponder on the vicissitudes of human
      destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he soon reminded me of his existence. Two months after his visit, I
      got a letter from him, the first of those letters, of which later on he
      furnished me with so abundant a supply. And note a peculiar fact: I have
      seldom seen a neater, more legible handwriting than that unbalanced
      fellow&rsquo;s. And the wording of his letters was exceedingly correct, just a
      little flowery. Invariable entreaties for assistance, always attended with
      resolutions to reform, vows, and promises on his honour.... All of it
      seemed&mdash;and perhaps was&mdash;sincere. Misha&rsquo;s signature to his
      letters was always accompanied by peculiar strokes, flourishes, and stops,
      and he made great use of marks of exclamation. In this first letter Misha
      informed me of a new &lsquo;turn in his fortune.&rsquo; (Later on he used to refer to
      these turns as plunges, ... and frequent were the plunges he took.) He was
      starting for the Caucasus on active service for his tsar and his country
      in the capacity of a cadet! And, though a certain benevolent aunt had
      entered into his impecunious position, and had sent him an inconsiderable
      sum, still he begged me to assist him in getting his equipment. I did what
      he asked, and for two years I heard nothing more of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must own I had the gravest doubts as to his having gone to the Caucasus.
      But it turned out that he really had gone there, had, by favour, got into
      the T&mdash;&mdash; regiment as a cadet, and had been serving in it for
      those two years. A perfect series of legends had sprung up there about
      him. An officer of his regiment related them to me.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      I learned a great deal which I should never have expected of him.&mdash;I
      was, of course, hardly surprised that as a military man, as an officer, he
      was not a success, that he was in fact worse than useless; but what I had
      not anticipated was that he was by no means conspicuous for much bravery;
      that in battle he had a downcast, woebegone air, seemed half-depressed,
      half-bewildered. Discipline of every sort worried him, and made him
      miserable; he was daring to the point of insanity when only his <i>own
      personal</i> safety was in question; no bet was too mad for him to accept;
      but do harm to others, kill, fight, he could not, possibly because his
      heart was too good&mdash;or possibly because his &lsquo;cottonwool&rsquo; education
      (so he expressed it), had made him too soft. Himself he was quite ready to
      murder in any way at any moment.... But others&mdash;no. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no
      making him out,&rsquo; his comrades said of him; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s a flabby creature, a poor
      stick&mdash;and yet such a desperate fellow&mdash;a perfect madman!&rsquo; I
      chanced in later days to ask Misha what evil spirit drove him, forced him,
      to drink to excess, risk his life, and so on. He always had one answer&mdash;&lsquo;wretchedness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why are you wretched?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why! how can you ask? If one comes, anyway, to one&rsquo;s self, begins to
      feel, to think of the poverty, of the injustice, of Russia.... Well, it&rsquo;s
      all over with me! ... one&rsquo;s so wretched at once&mdash;one wants to put a
      bullet through one&rsquo;s head! One&rsquo;s forced to start drinking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why ever do you drag Russia in?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I help it? Can&rsquo;t be helped! That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m afraid to think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It all comes, and your wretchedness too, from having nothing to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t know how to do anything, uncle! dear fellow! Take one&rsquo;s life,
      and stake it on a card&mdash;that I can do! Come, you tell me what I ought
      to do, what to risk my life for? This instant ... I&rsquo;ll ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you must simply live.... Why risk your life?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t! You say I act thoughtlessly.... But what else can I do? ... If
      one starts thinking&mdash;good God, all that comes into one&rsquo;s head! It&rsquo;s
      only Germans who can think! ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What use was it talking to him? He was a desperate man, and that&rsquo;s all one
      can say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the Caucasus legends I have spoken about, I will tell you two or three.
      One day, in a party of officers, Misha began boasting of a sabre he had
      got by exchange&mdash;&lsquo;a genuine Persian blade!&rsquo; The officers expressed
      doubts as to its genuineness. Misha began disputing. &lsquo;Here then,&rsquo; he cried
      at last; &lsquo;they say the man that knows most about sabres is Abdulka the
      one-eyed. I&rsquo;ll go to him, and ask.&rsquo; The officers wondered. &lsquo;What Abdulka?
      Do you mean that lives in the mountains? The rebel never subdued?
      Abdul-khan?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s him.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, but he&rsquo;ll take you for a spy, will
      put you in a hole full of bugs, or else cut your head off with your own
      sabre. And, besides, how are you going to get to him? They&rsquo;ll catch you
      directly.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to him, though, all the same.&rsquo; &lsquo;Bet you won&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Taken!&rsquo; And Misha promptly saddled his horse and rode off to Abdulka. He
      disappeared for three days. All felt certain that the crazy fellow had
      come by his end. But, behold! he came back&mdash;drunk, and with a sabre,
      not the one he had taken, but another. They began questioning him. &lsquo;It was
      all right,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;Abdulka&rsquo;s a nice fellow. At first, it&rsquo;s true, he
      ordered them to put irons on my legs, and was even on the point of having
      me impaled. Only, I explained why I had come, and showed him the sabre.
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;d better not keep me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t expect a ransom for me;
      I&rsquo;ve not a farthing to bless myself with&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve no relations.&rdquo;
       Abdulka was surprised; he looked at me with his solitary eye. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;you are a bold one, you Russian; am I to believe you?&rdquo; &ldquo;You may
      believe me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I never tell a lie.&rdquo; (And this was true; Misha never
      lied.) Abdulka looked at me again. &ldquo;And do you know how to drink wine?&rdquo; &ldquo;I
      do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;give me as much as you will, I&rsquo;ll drink it.&rdquo; Abdulka was
      surprised again; he called on Allah. And he told his&mdash;daughter, I
      suppose&mdash;such a pretty creature, only with an eye like a jackal&rsquo;s&mdash;to
      bring a wine-skin. And I began to get to work on it. &ldquo;But your sabre,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t genuine; here, take the real thing. And now we are pledged
      friends.&rdquo; But you&rsquo;ve lost your bet, gentlemen; pay up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The second legend of Misha is of this nature. He was passionately fond of
      cards; but as he had no money, and could never pay his debts at cards
      (though he was never a card-sharper), no one at last would sit down to a
      game with him. So one day he began urgently begging one of his comrades
      among the officers to play with him! &lsquo;But if you lose, you don&rsquo;t pay.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;The money certainly I can&rsquo;t pay, but I&rsquo;ll put a shot through my left
      hand, see, with this pistol here!&rsquo; &lsquo;But whatever use will that be to me?&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;No use, but still it will be curious.&rsquo; This conversation took place after
      a drinking bout in the presence of witnesses. Whether it was that Misha&rsquo;s
      proposition struck the officer as really curious&mdash;anyway he agreed.
      Cards were brought, the game began. Misha was in luck; he won a hundred
      roubles. And thereupon his opponent struck his forehead with vexation.
      &lsquo;What an ass I am!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;to be taken in like this! As if you&rsquo;d have
      shot your hand if you had lost!&mdash;a likely story! hold out your
      purse!&rsquo; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rsquo; retorted Misha: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve won&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll shoot my
      hand.&rsquo; He snatched up his pistol&mdash;and bang, fired at his own hand.
      The bullet passed right through it ... and in a week the wound had
      completely healed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another time, Misha was riding with his comrades along a road at night ...
      and they saw close to the roadside a narrow ravine like a deep cleft, dark&mdash;so
      dark you couldn&rsquo;t see the bottom. &lsquo;Look,&rsquo; said one of the officers, &lsquo;Misha
      may be a desperate fellow, but he wouldn&rsquo;t leap into that ravine.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,
      I&rsquo;d leap in!&rsquo; &lsquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t, for I dare say it&rsquo;s seventy feet deep,
      and you might break your neck.&rsquo; His friend knew his weak point&mdash;vanity....
      There was a great deal of it in Misha. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll leap in anyway! Would you
      like to bet on it? Ten roubles.&rsquo; &lsquo;Good!&rsquo; And the officer had hardly
      uttered the word, when Misha and his horse were off&mdash;into the ravine&mdash;and
      crashing down over the stones. All were simply petrified.... A full minute
      passed, and they heard Misha&rsquo;s voice, dimly, as it were rising up out of
      the bowels of the earth: &lsquo;All right! fell on the sand ... but it was a
      long flight! Ten roubles you&rsquo;ve lost!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Climb out!&rsquo; shouted his comrades. &lsquo;Climb out, I dare say!&rsquo; echoed Misha.
      &lsquo;A likely story! I should like to see you climb out. You&rsquo;ll have to go for
      torches and ropes now. And, meanwhile, to keep up my spirits while I wait,
      fling down a flask....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Misha had to stay five hours at the bottom of the ravine; and when
      they dragged him out, it turned out that his shoulder was dislocated. But
      that in no way troubled him. The next day a bone-setter, one of the
      black-smiths, set his shoulder, and he used it as though nothing had been
      the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      His health in general was marvellous, incredible. I have already mentioned
      that up to the time of his death he kept his almost childishly fresh
      complexion. Illness was a thing unknown to him, in spite of his excesses;
      the strength of his constitution never once showed signs of giving way.
      When any other man would infallibly have been seriously ill, or even have
      died, he merely shook himself, like a duck in the water, and was more
      blooming than ever. Once, also in the Caucasus ... <i>this</i> legend is
      really incredible, but one may judge from it what Misha was thought to be
      capable of.... Well, once, in the Caucasus, in a state of drunkenness, he
      fell down with the lower half of his body in a stream of water; his head
      and arms were on the bank, out of water. It was winter-time, there was a
      hard frost, and when he was found next morning, his legs and body were
      pulled out from under a thick layer of ice, which had formed over them in
      the night&mdash;and he didn&rsquo;t even catch cold! Another time&mdash;this was
      in Russia (near Orel, and also in a time of severe frost)&mdash;he was in
      a tavern outside the town in company with seven young seminarists (or
      theological students), and these seminarists were celebrating their final
      examination, but had invited Misha, as a delightful person, a man of
      &lsquo;inspiration,&rsquo; as the phrase was then. A very great deal was drunk, and
      when at last the festive party got ready to depart, Misha, dead drunk, was
      in an unconscious condition. All the seven seminarists together had but
      one three-horse sledge with a high back; where were they to stow the
      unresisting body? Then one of the young men, inspired by classical
      reminiscences, proposed tying Misha by his feet to the back of the sledge,
      as Hector was tied to the chariot of Achilles! The proposal met with
      approval ... and jolting up and down over the holes, sliding sideways down
      the slopes, with his legs torn and flayed, and his head rolling in the
      snow, poor Misha travelled on his back for the mile and a half from the
      tavern to the town, and hadn&rsquo;t as much as a cough afterwards, hadn&rsquo;t
      turned a hair! Such heroic health had nature bestowed upon him!

    </h2>
    <p>
      From the Caucasus he came again to Moscow, in a Circassian dress, a dagger
      in his sash, a high-peaked cap on his head. This costume he retained to
      the end, though he was no longer in the army, from which he had been
      discharged for outstaying his leave. He stayed with me, borrowed a little
      money ... and forthwith began his &lsquo;plunges,&rsquo; his wanderings, or, as he
      expressed it, &lsquo;his peregrinations from pillar to post,&rsquo; then came the
      sudden disappearances and returns, and the showers of beautifully written
      letters addressed to people of every possible description, from an
      archbishop down to stable-boys and mid-wives! Then came calls upon persons
      known and unknown! And this is worth noticing: when he made these calls,
      he was never abject and cringing, he never worried people by begging, but
      on the contrary behaved with propriety, and had positively a cheerful and
      pleasant air, though the inveterate smell of spirits accompanied him
      everywhere, and his Oriental costume gradually changed into rags. &lsquo;Give,
      and God will reward you, though I don&rsquo;t deserve it,&rsquo; he would say, with a
      bright smile and a candid blush; &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t give, you&rsquo;ll be perfectly
      right, and I shan&rsquo;t blame you for it. I shall find food to eat, God will
      provide! And there are people poorer than I, and much more deserving of
      help&mdash;plenty, plenty!&rsquo; Misha was particularly successful with women:
      he knew how to appeal to their sympathy. But don&rsquo;t suppose that he was or
      fancied himself a Lovelace....Oh, no! in that way he was very modest.
      Whether it was that he had inherited a cool temperament from his parents,
      or whether indeed this too is to be set down to his dislike for doing any
      one harm&mdash;as, according to his notions, relations with a woman meant
      inevitably doing a woman harm&mdash;I won&rsquo;t undertake to decide; only in
      all his behaviour with the fair sex he was extremely delicate. Women felt
      this, and were the more ready to sympathise with him and help him, until
      at last he revolted them by his drunkenness and debauchery, by the
      desperateness of which I have spoken already.... I can think of no other
      word for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in other relations he had by that time lost every sort of delicacy,
      and was gradually sinking to the lowest depths of degradation. He once, in
      the public assembly at T&mdash;&mdash;, got as far as setting on the table
      a jug with a notice: &lsquo;Any one, to whom it may seem agreeable to give the
      high-born nobleman Poltyev (authentic documents in proof of his pedigree
      are herewith exposed) a flip on the nose, may satisfy this inclination on
      putting a rouble into this jug.&rsquo; And I am told there were persons found
      willing to pay for the privilege of flipping a nobleman&rsquo;s nose! It is true
      that one such person, who put in only one rouble and gave him <i>two</i>
      flips, he first almost strangled, and then forced to apologise; it is
      true, too, that part of the money gained in this fashion he promptly
      distributed among other poor devils ... but still, think what a disgrace!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of his &lsquo;peregrinations from pillar to post,&rsquo; he made his
      way, too, to his ancestral home, which he had sold for next to nothing to
      a speculator and money-lender well known in those days. The money-lender
      was at home, and hearing of the presence in the neighbourhood of the
      former owner, now reduced to vagrancy, he gave orders not to admit him
      into the house, and even, in case of necessity, to drive him away. Misha
      announced that he would not for his part consent to enter the house,
      polluted by the presence of so repulsive a person; that he would permit no
      one to drive him away, but was going to the churchyard to pay his
      devotions at the grave of his parents. So in fact he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the churchyard he was joined by an old house-serf, who had once been
      his nurse. The money-lender had deprived this old man of his monthly
      allowance, and driven him off the estate; since then his refuge had been a
      corner in a peasant&rsquo;s hut. Misha had been too short a time in possession
      of his estate to have left behind him a particularly favourable memory;
      still the old servant could not resist running to the churchyard as soon
      as he heard of his young master&rsquo;s being there. He found Misha sitting on
      the ground between the tombstones, asked for his hand to kiss, as in old
      times, and even shed tears on seeing the rags which clothed the limbs of
      his once pampered young charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Misha gazed long and silently at the old man. &lsquo;Timofay!&rsquo; he said at last;
      Timofay started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you desire?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you a spade?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can get one.... But what do you want with a spade, Mihailo Andreitch,
      sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want to dig myself a grave, Timofay, and to lie here for time
      everlasting between my father and mother. There&rsquo;s only this spot left me
      in the world. Get a spade!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said Timofay; he went and got it. And Misha began at once
      digging in the ground, while Timofay stood by, his chin propped in his
      hand, repeating: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s left for you and me, master!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Misha dug and dug, from time to time observing: &lsquo;Life&rsquo;s not worth living,
      is it, Timofay?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not indeed, master.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The hole was already of a good depth. People saw what Misha was about, and
      ran to tell the new owner about it. The money-lender was at first very
      angry, wanted to send for the police: &lsquo;This is sacrilege,&rsquo; said he. But
      afterwards, probably reflecting that it was inconvenient anyway to have to
      do with such a madman, and that it might lead to a scandal,&mdash;he went
      in his own person to the churchyard, and approaching Misha, still toiling,
      made him a polite bow. He went on with his digging as though he had not
      noticed his successor. &lsquo;Mihail Andreitch,&rsquo; began the money-lender, &lsquo;allow
      me to ask what you are doing here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can see&mdash;I am digging myself a grave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why are you doing so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want to live any longer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The money-lender fairly threw up his hands in amazement. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t want
      to live?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Misha glanced menacingly at the money-lender. &lsquo;That surprises you? Aren&rsquo;t
      you the cause of it all? ... You? ... You? ... Wasn&rsquo;t it you, Judas, who
      robbed me, taking advantage of my childishness? Aren&rsquo;t you flaying the
      peasants&rsquo; skins off their backs? Haven&rsquo;t you taken from this poor old man
      his crust of dry bread? Wasn&rsquo;t it you? ... O God! everywhere nothing but
      injustice, and oppression, and evil-doing.... Everything must go to ruin
      then, and me too! I don&rsquo;t care for life, I don&rsquo;t care for life in Russia!&rsquo; 
      And the spade moved faster than ever in Misha&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a devil of a business!&rsquo; thought the money-lender; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s positively
      burying himself alive.&rsquo; &lsquo;Mihail Andreevitch,&rsquo; he began again: &lsquo;listen.
      I&rsquo;ve been behaving badly to you, indeed; they told me falsely of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Misha went on digging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why be desperate?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Misha still went on digging, and kept throwing the earth at the
      money-lender&rsquo;s feet, as though to say, &lsquo;Here you are, land-grabber.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, you &lsquo;re wrong in this. Won&rsquo;t you be pleased to come in to have
      some lunch, and rest a bit?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Misha raised his head. &lsquo;So that&rsquo;s it now! And anything to drink?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The money-lender was delighted. &lsquo;Why, of course ... I should think so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You invite Timofay too?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, ... yes, him too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Misha pondered. &lsquo;Only, mind ... you made me a beggar, you know.... Don&rsquo;t
      think you can get off with one bottle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Set your mind at rest ... there shall be all you can want.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Misha got up and flung down the spade.... &lsquo;Well, Timosha,&rsquo; said he to his
      old nurse; &lsquo;let&rsquo;s do honour to our host.... Come along.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; answered the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all three started off to the house together. The money-lender knew the
      man he had to deal with. At the first start Misha, it is true, exacted a
      promise from him to &lsquo;grant all sorts of immunities&rsquo; to the peasants; but
      an hour later, this same Misha, together with Timofay, both drunk, were
      dancing a galop in the big apartments, which still seemed pervaded by the
      God-fearing shade of Andrei Nikolaevitch; and an hour later still, Misha
      in a dead sleep (he had a very weak head for spirits), laid in a cart with
      his high cap and dagger, was being driven off to the town, more than
      twenty miles away, and there was flung under a hedge.... As for Timofay,
      who could still keep on his legs, and only hiccupped&mdash;him, of course,
      they kicked out of the house; since they couldn&rsquo;t get at the master, they
      had to be content with the old servant.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some time passed again, and I heard nothing of Misha.... God knows what he
      was doing. But one day, as I sat over the samovar at a posting-station on
      the T&mdash;&mdash; highroad, waiting for horses, I suddenly heard under
      the open window of the station room a hoarse voice, uttering in French the
      words: &lsquo;Monsieur ... monsieur ... prenez pitié d&rsquo;un pauvre gentil-homme
      ruiné.&rsquo; ... I lifted my head, glanced.... The mangy-looking fur cap, the
      broken ornaments on the ragged Circassian dress, the dagger in the cracked
      sheath, the swollen, but still rosy face, the dishevelled, but still thick
      crop of hair.... Mercy on us! Misha! He had come then to begging alms on
      the high-roads. I could not help crying out. He recognised me, started,
      turned away, and was about to move away from the window. I stopped him ...
      but what could I say to him? Give him a lecture? ... In silence I held out
      a five-rouble note; he, also in silence, took it in his still white and
      plump, though shaking and dirty hand, and vanished round the corner of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a good while before they gave me horses, and I had time to give
      myself up to gloomy reflections on my unexpected meeting with Misha; I
      felt ashamed of having let him go so unsympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I set off on my way, and half a mile from the station I observed
      ahead of me, in the road, a crowd of people moving along with a curious,
      as it seemed rhythmic, step. I overtook this crowd&mdash;and what did I
      see?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some dozen or so beggars, with sacks over their shoulders, were walking
      two by two, singing and leaping about, while in front of them danced
      Misha, stamping time with his feet, and shouting, &lsquo;Natchiki-tchikaldy,
      tchuk, tchuk, tchuk! ... Natchiki-tchikaldy, tchuk, tchuk, tchuk!&rsquo; 
      Directly my carriage caught them up, and he saw me, he began at once
      shouting, &lsquo;Hurrah! Stand in position! right about face, guard of the
      roadside!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The beggars took up his shout, and halted; while he, with his peculiar
      laugh, jumped on to the carriage step, and again yelled: Hurrah!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rsquo; I asked with involuntary astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This? This is my company, my army&mdash;all beggars, God&rsquo;s people,
      friends of my heart. Every one of them, thanks to you, has had a glass;
      and now we are all rejoicing and making merry! ... Uncle! Do you know it&rsquo;s
      only with beggars, God&rsquo;s people, that one can live in the world ... by
      God, it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I made him no answer ... but at that moment he struck me as such a kind
      good creature, his face expressed such childlike simple-heartedness.... A
      light seemed suddenly as it were to dawn upon me, and I felt a pang in my
      heart.... &lsquo;Get into the carriage,&rsquo; I said to him. He was taken aback....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? Into the carriage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, get in, get in,&rsquo; I repeated; &lsquo;I want to make you a suggestion. Sit
      down.... Come along with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, as you will.&rsquo; He sat down. &lsquo;Well, and you, my honoured friends, my
      dear comrades,&rsquo; he added, addressing the beggars, &lsquo;fare-well, till we meet
      again.&rsquo; Misha took off his high cap, and bowed low. The beggars all seemed
      overawed.... I told the coachman to whip up the horses, and the carriage
      rolled off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion I wanted to make Misha was this: the idea suddenly occurred
      to me to take him with me to my home in the country, about five-and-twenty
      miles from that station, to rescue him, or at least to make an effort to
      rescue him. &lsquo;Listen, Misha,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;will you come along and live with
      me? ... You shall have everything provided you; you shall have clothes and
      linen made you; you shall be properly fitted out, and you shall have money
      to spend on tobacco, and so on, only on one condition, that you give up
      drink.... Do you agree?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Misha was positively aghast with delight; he opened his eyes wide, flushed
      crimson, and suddenly falling on my shoulder, began kissing me, and
      repeating in a broken voice, &lsquo;Uncle ... benefactor ... God reward you.&rsquo; 
      ... He burst into tears at last, and taking off his cap fell to wiping his
      eyes, his nose, his lips with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind,&rsquo; I observed; &lsquo;remember the condition, not to touch strong drink.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damnation to it!&rsquo; he cried, with a wave of both arms, and with this
      impetuous movement, I was more than ever conscious of the strong smell of
      spirits with which he seemed always saturated.... &lsquo;Uncle, if you knew what
      my life has been.... If it hadn&rsquo;t been for sorrow, a cruel fate.... But
      now I swear, I swear, I will mend my ways, I will show you.... Uncle, I&rsquo;ve
      never told a lie&mdash;you can ask whom you like.... I&rsquo;m honest, but I&rsquo;m
      an unlucky fellow, uncle; I&rsquo;ve known no kindness from any one....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he broke down finally into sobs. I tried to soothe him, and succeeded
      so far that when we reached home Misha had long been lost in a heavy
      sleep, with his head on my knees.

    </h2>
    <p>
      He was at once assigned a room for himself, and at once, first thing,
      taken to the bath, which was absolutely essential. All his clothes, and
      his dagger and cap and torn boots, were carefully put away in a loft; he
      was dressed in clean linen, slippers, and some clothes of mine, which, as
      is always the way with poor relations, at once seemed to adapt themselves
      to his size and figure. When he came to table, washed, clean, and fresh,
      he seemed so touched and happy, he beamed all over with such joyful
      gratitude, that I too felt moved and joyful.... His face was completely
      transformed.... Boys of twelve have faces like that on Easter Sundays,
      after the communion, when, thickly pomaded, in new jacket and starched
      collars, they come to exchange Easter greetings with their parents. Misha
      was continually&mdash;with a sort of cautious incredulity&mdash;feeling
      himself and repeating: &lsquo;What does it mean? ... Am I in heaven?&rsquo; The next
      day he announced that he had not slept all night, he had been in such
      ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had living in my house at that time an old aunt with her niece; both of
      them were extremely disturbed when they heard of Misha&rsquo;s presence; they
      could not comprehend how I could have asked him into my house! There were
      very ugly rumours about him. But in the first place, I knew he was always
      very courteous with ladies; and, secondly, I counted on his promises of
      amendment. And, in fact, for the first two days of his stay under my roof
      Misha not merely justified my expectations but surpassed them, while the
      ladies of the household were simply enchanted with him. He played piquet
      with the old lady, helped her to wind her worsted, showed her two new
      games of patience; for the niece, who had a small voice, he played
      accompaniments on the piano, and read Russian and French poetry. He told
      both the ladies lively but discreet anecdotes; in fact, he showed them
      every attention, so that they repeatedly expressed their surprise to me,
      and the old lady even observed how unjust people sometimes were.... The
      things&mdash;the things they had said of him ... and he such a quiet
      fellow, and so polite ... poor Misha! It is true that at table &lsquo;poor
      Misha&rsquo; licked his lips in a rather peculiar, hurried way, if he simply
      glanced at the bottle. But I had only to shake my finger at him, and he
      would turn his eyes upwards, and lay his hand on his heart ... as if to
      say, I have sworn.... &lsquo;I am regenerated now,&rsquo; he assured me.... &lsquo;Well, God
      grant it be so,&rsquo; was my thought.... But this regeneration did not last
      long.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first two days he was very talkative and cheerful. But even on the
      third day he seemed somehow subdued, though he remained, as before, with
      the ladies and tried to entertain them. A half mournful, half dreamy
      expression flitted now and then over his face, and the face itself was
      paler and looked thinner. &lsquo;Are you unwell?&rsquo; I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;my head aches a little.&rsquo; On the fourth day he was
      completely silent; for the most part he sat in a corner, hanging his head
      disconsolately, and his dejected appearance worked upon the compassionate
      sympathies of the two ladies, who now, in their turn, tried to amuse him.
      At table he ate nothing, stared at his plate, and rolled up pellets of
      bread. On the fifth day the feeling of compassion in the ladies began to
      be replaced by other emotions&mdash;uneasiness and even alarm. Misha was
      so strange, he held aloof from people, and kept moving along close to the
      walls, as though trying to steal by unnoticed, and suddenly looking round
      as though some one had called him. And what had become of his rosy colour?
      It seemed covered over by a layer of earth. &lsquo;Are you still unwell?&rsquo; I
      asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m all right,&rsquo; he answered abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you dull?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should I be dull?&rsquo; But he turned away and would not look me in the
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or is it that wretchedness come over you again?&rsquo; To this he made no
      reply. So passed another twenty-four hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day my aunt ran into my room in a state of great excitement,
      declaring that she would leave the house with her niece, if Misha was to
      remain in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, we are dreadfully scared with him.... He&rsquo;s not a man, he&rsquo;s a wolf,&mdash;nothing
      better than a wolf. He keeps moving and moving about, and doesn&rsquo;t speak&mdash;and
      looks so wild.... He almost gnashes his teeth at me. My Katia, you know,
      is so nervous.... She was so struck with him the first day.... I&rsquo;m in
      terror for her, and indeed for myself too.&rsquo; ... I didn&rsquo;t know what to say
      to my aunt. I couldn&rsquo;t, anyway, turn Misha out, after inviting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He relieved me himself from my difficult position. The same day,&mdash;I
      was still sitting in my own room,&mdash;suddenly I heard behind me a husky
      and angry voice: &lsquo;Nikolai Nikolaitch, Nikolai Nikolaitch!&rsquo; I looked round;
      Misha was standing in the doorway with a face that was fearful,
      black-looking and distorted. &lsquo;Nikolai Nikolaitch!&rsquo; he repeated ... (not
      &lsquo;uncle&rsquo; now).
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me go ... at once!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me go, or I shall do mischief, I shall set the house on fire or cut
      some one&rsquo;s throat.&rsquo; Misha suddenly began trembling. &lsquo;Tell them to give me
      back my clothes, and let a cart take me to the highroad, and let me have
      some money, however little!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you displeased, then, at anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t live like this!&rsquo; he shrieked at the top of his voice. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
      live in your respectable, thrice-accursed house! It makes me sick, and
      ashamed to live so quietly! ... How <i>you</i> manage to endure it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is,&rsquo; I interrupted in my turn, &lsquo;you mean&mdash;you can&rsquo;t live
      without drink....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, yes! yes!&rsquo; he shrieked again: &lsquo;only let me go to my brethren, my
      friends, to the beggars! ... Away from your respectable, loathsome
      species!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was about to remind him of his sworn promises, but Misha&rsquo;s frenzied
      look, his breaking voice, the convulsive tremor in his limbs,&mdash;it was
      all so awful, that I made haste to get rid of him; I said that his clothes
      should be given him at once, and a cart got ready; and taking a note for
      twenty-five roubles out of a drawer, I laid it on the table. Misha had
      begun to advance in a menacing way towards me,&mdash;but on this, suddenly
      he stopped, his face worked, flushed, he struck himself on the breast, the
      tears rushed from his eyes, and muttering, &lsquo;Uncle! angel! I know I&rsquo;m a
      ruined man! thanks! thanks!&rsquo; he snatched up the note and ran away.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later he was sitting in the cart dressed once more in his
      Circassian costume, again rosy and cheerful; and when the horses started,
      he yelled, tore off the peaked cap, and, waving it over his head, made bow
      after bow. Just as he was going off, he had given me a long and warm
      embrace, and whispered, &lsquo;Benefactor, benefactor ... there&rsquo;s no saving me!&rsquo; 
      He even ran to the ladies and kissed their hands, fell on his knees,
      called upon God, and begged their forgiveness! Katia I found afterwards in
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman, with whom Misha had set off, on coming home informed me that
      he had driven him to the first tavern on the highroad&mdash;and that there
      &lsquo;his honour had stuck,&rsquo; had begun treating every one indiscriminately&mdash;and
      had quickly sunk into unconsciousness. From that day I never came across
      Misha again, but his ultimate fate I learned in the following manner.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Three years later, I was again at home in the country; all of a sudden a
      servant came in and announced that Madame Poltyev was asking to see me. I
      knew no Madame Poltyev, and the servant, who made this announcement, for
      some unknown reason smiled sarcastically. To my glance of inquiry, he
      responded that the lady asking for me was young, poorly dressed, and had
      come in a peasant&rsquo;s cart with one horse, which she was driving herself! I
      told him to ask Madame Poltyev up to my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw a woman of five-and-twenty, in the dress of the small tradesman
      class, with a large kerchief on her head. Her face was simple, roundish,
      not without charm; she looked dejected and gloomy, and was shy and awkward
      in her movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are Madame Poltyev?&rsquo; I inquired, and I asked her to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered in a subdued voice, and she did not sit down. &lsquo;I am
      the widow of your nephew, Mihail Andreevitch Poltyev.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mihail Andreevitch dead? Has he been dead long? But sit down, I beg.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s two months.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And had you been married to him long?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had been a year with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where have you come from now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From out Tula way.... There&rsquo;s a village there, Znamenskoe-Glushkovo&mdash;perhaps
      you may know it. I am the daughter of the deacon there. Mihail Andreitch
      and I lived there.... He lived in my father&rsquo;s house. We were a whole year
      together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman&rsquo;s lips twitched a little, and she put her hand up to them.
      She seemed to be on the point of tears, but she controlled herself, and
      cleared her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mihail Andreitch,&rsquo; she went on: &lsquo;before his death enjoined upon me to go
      to you; &ldquo;You must be sure to go,&rdquo; said he! And he told me to thank you for
      all your goodness, and to give you ... this ... see, this little thing
      (she took a small packet out of her pocket) which he always had about
      him.... And Mihail Andreitch said, if you would be pleased to accept it in
      memory of him, if you would not disdain it.... &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;I can give him&rdquo; ... that is, you....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the packet there was a little silver cup with the monogram of Misha&rsquo;s
      mother. This cup I had often seen in Misha&rsquo;s hands, and once he had even
      said to me, speaking of some poor fellow, that he really was destitute,
      since he had neither cup nor bowl, &lsquo;while I, see, have this anyway.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked her, took the cup, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of what complaint had Misha died? No doubt....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I bit my tongue ... but the young woman understood my unuttered
      hint.... She took a swift glance at me, then looked down again, smiled
      mournfully, and said at once: &lsquo;Oh no! he had quite given that up, ever
      since he got to know me ... But he had no health at all! ... It was
      shattered quite. As soon as he gave up drink, he fell into ill health
      directly. He became so steady; he always wanted to help father in his land
      or in the garden, ... or any other work there might be ... in spite of his
      being of noble birth. But how could he get the strength? ... At writing,
      too, he tried to work; as you know, he could do that work capitally, but
      his hands shook, and he couldn&rsquo;t hold the pen properly. ... He was always
      finding fault with himself; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a white-handed poor creature,&rdquo; he would
      say; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done any good to anybody, never helped, never laboured!&rdquo;
       He worried himself very much about that.... He used to say that our people
      labour,&mdash;but what use are we? ... Ah, Nikolai Nikolaitch, he was a
      good man&mdash;and he was fond of me ... and I... Ah, pardon me....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the young woman wept outright. I would have consoled her, but I did
      not know how.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you a child left you?&rsquo; I asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed. &lsquo;No, no child.... Is it likely?&rsquo; And her tears flowed faster
      than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so that was how Misha&rsquo;s troubled wanderings had ended,&rsquo; the old man
      P. wound up his narrative. &lsquo;You will agree with me, I am sure, that I&rsquo;m
      right in calling him a desperate character; but you will most likely agree
      too that he was not like the desperate characters of to-day; still, a
      philosopher, you must admit, would find a family likeness between him and
      them. In him and in them there&rsquo;s the thirst for self-destruction, the
      wretchedness, the dissatisfaction.... And what it all comes from, I leave
      the philosopher to decide.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fifteen years ago&mdash;began H.&mdash;official duties compelled me to
      spend a few days in the principal town of the province of T&mdash;&mdash;.
      I stopped at a very fair hotel, which had been established six months
      before my arrival by a Jewish tailor, who had grown rich. I am told that
      it did not flourish long, which is often the case with us; but I found it
      still in its full splendour: the new furniture emitted cracks like
      pistol-shots at night; the bed-linen, table-cloths, and napkins smelt of
      soap, and the painted floors reeked of olive oil, which, however, in the
      opinion of the waiter, an exceedingly elegant but not very clean
      individual, tended to prevent the spread of insects. This waiter, a former
      valet of Prince G.&lsquo;s, was conspicuous for his free-and-easy manners and
      his self-assurance. He invariably wore a second-hand frockcoat and
      slippers trodden down at heel, carried a table-napkin under his arm, and
      had a multitude of pimples on his cheeks. With a free sweeping movement of
      his moist hands he gave utterance to brief but pregnant observations. He
      showed a patronising interest in me, as a person capable of appreciating
      his culture and knowledge of the world; but he regarded his own lot in
      life with a rather disillusioned eye. &lsquo;No doubt about it,&rsquo; he said to me
      one day; &lsquo;ours is a poor sort of position nowadays. May be sent flying any
      day!&rsquo; His name was Ardalion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to make a few visits to official persons in the town. Ardalion
      procured me a coach and groom, both alike shabby and loose in the joints;
      but the groom wore livery, the carriage was adorned with an heraldic
      crest. After making all my official calls, I drove to see a country
      gentleman, an old friend of my father&rsquo;s, who had been a long time settled
      in the town.... I had not met him for twenty years; he had had time to get
      married, to bring up a good-sized family, to be left a widower and to make
      his fortune. His business was with government monopolies, that is to say,
      he lent contractors for monopolies loans at heavy interest.... &lsquo;There is
      always honour in risk,&rsquo; they say, though indeed the risk was small.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of our conversation there came into the room with hesitating
      steps, but as lightly as though on tiptoe, a young girl of about
      seventeen, delicate-looking and thin. &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said my acquaintance, &lsquo;is my
      eldest daughter Sophia; let me introduce you. She takes my poor wife&rsquo;s
      place, looks after the house, and takes care of her brothers and sisters.&rsquo; 
      I bowed a second time to the girl who had come in (she meanwhile dropped
      into a chair without speaking), and thought to myself that she did not
      look much like housekeeping or looking after children. Her face was quite
      childish, round, with small, pleasing, but immobile features; the blue
      eyes, under high, also immobile and irregular eyebrows, had an intent,
      almost astonished look, as though they had just observed something
      unexpected; the full little mouth with the lifted upper lip, not only did
      not smile, but seemed as though altogether innocent of such a practice;
      the rosy flush under the tender skin stood in soft, diffused patches on
      the cheeks, and neither paled nor deepened. The fluffy, fair hair hung in
      light clusters each side of the little head. Her bosom breathed softly,
      and her arms were pressed somehow awkwardly and severely against her
      narrow waist. Her blue gown fell without folds&mdash;like a child&rsquo;s&mdash;to
      her little feet. The general impression this girl made upon me was not one
      of morbidity, but of something enigmatical. I saw before me not simply a
      shy, provincial miss, but a creature of a special type&mdash;that I could
      not make out. This type neither attracted nor repelled me; I did not fully
      understand it, and only felt that I had never come across a nature more
      sincere. Pity ... yes! pity was the feeling that rose up within me at the
      sight of this young, serious, keenly alert life&mdash;God knows why! &lsquo;Not
      of this earth,&rsquo; was my thought, though there was nothing exactly &lsquo;ideal&rsquo; 
      in the expression of the face, and though Mademoiselle Sophie had
      obviously come into the drawing-room in fulfilment of those duties of lady
      of the house to which her father had referred.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to talk of life in the town of T&mdash;&mdash;, of the social
      amusements and advantages it offered. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re very quiet here,&rsquo; he
      observed; &lsquo;the governor&rsquo;s a melancholy fellow; the marshal of the province
      is a bachelor. But there&rsquo;ll be a big ball in the Hall of the Nobility the
      day after to-morrow. I advise you to go; there are some pretty girls here.
      And you&rsquo;ll see all our <i>intelligentsi</i> too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My acquaintance, as a man of university education, was fond of using
      learned expressions. He pronounced them with irony, but also with respect.
      Besides, we all know that moneylending, together with respectability,
      developes a certain thoughtfulness in men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Allow me to ask, will you be at the ball?&rsquo; I said, turning to my friend&rsquo;s
      daughter. I wanted to hear the sound of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa intends to go,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;and I with him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice turned out to be soft and deliberate, and she articulated every
      syllable fully, as though she were puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case, allow me to ask you for the first quadrille.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent her head in token of assent, and even then did not smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon withdrew, and I remember the expression in her eyes, fixed steadily
      upon me, struck me as so strange that I involuntarily looked over my
      shoulder to see whether there were not some one or some thing she was
      looking at behind my back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to the hotel, and after dining on the never-varied
      &lsquo;soupe-julienne,&rsquo; cutlets, and green peas, and grouse cooked to a dry,
      black chip, I sat down on the sofa and gave myself up to reflection. The
      subject of my meditations was Sophia, this enigmatical daughter of my old
      acquaintance; but Ardalion, who was clearing the table, explained my
      thoughtfulness in his own way; he set it down to boredom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is very little in the way of entertainment for visitors in our
      town,&rsquo; he began with his usual easy condescension, while he went on at the
      same time flapping the backs of the chairs with a dirty dinner-napkin&mdash;a
      practice peculiar, as you&rsquo;re doubtless aware, to servants of superior
      education. &lsquo;Very little!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and the huge clock on the wall, with a lilac rose on its white
      face, seemed in its monotonous, sleepy tick, to repeat his words: &lsquo;Ve-ry!
      ve-ry!&rsquo; it ticked. &lsquo;No concerts, nor theatres,&rsquo; pursued Ardalion (he had
      travelled abroad with his master, and had all but stayed in Paris; he knew
      much better than to mispronounce this last word, as the peasants do)&mdash;&lsquo;nor
      dances, for example; nor evening receptions among the nobility and gentry&mdash;there
      is nothing of the kind whatever.&rsquo; (He paused a moment, probably to allow
      me to observe the choiceness of his diction.) &lsquo;They positively visit each
      other but seldom. Every one sits like a pigeon on its perch. And so it
      comes to pass that visitors have simply nowhere to go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ardalion stole a sidelong glance at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there is one thing,&rsquo; he went on, speaking with a drawl, &lsquo;in case you
      should feel that way inclined....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at me a second time and positively leered, but I suppose did
      not observe signs of the requisite inclination in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The polished waiter moved towards the door, pondered a moment, came back,
      and after fidgeting about uneasily a little, bent down to my ear, and with
      a playful smile said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you not like to behold the dead?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared at him in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he went on, speaking in a whisper; &lsquo;there is a man like that here.
      He&rsquo;s a simple artisan, and can&rsquo;t even read and write, but he does
      marvellous things. If you, for example, go to him and desire to see any
      one of your departed friends, he will be sure to show him you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How does he do it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s his secret. For though he&rsquo;s an uneducated man&mdash;to speak
      bluntly, illiterate&mdash;he&rsquo;s very great in godliness! Greatly respected
      he is among the merchant gentry!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And does every one in the town know about this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those who need to know; but, there, of course&mdash;there&rsquo;s danger from
      the police to be guarded against. Because, say what you will, such doings
      are forbidden anyway, and for the common people are a temptation; the
      common people&mdash;the mob, we all know, quickly come to blows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he shown you the dead?&rsquo; I asked Ardalion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ardalion nodded. &lsquo;He has; my father he brought before me as if living.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared at Ardalion. He laughed and played with his dinner-napkin, and
      condescendingly, but unflinchingly, looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But this is very curious!&rsquo; I cried at last. &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I make the
      acquaintance of this artisan?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t go straight to him; but one can act through his mother. She&rsquo;s a
      respectable old woman; she sells pickled apples on the bridge. If you wish
      it, I will ask her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ardalion coughed behind his hand. &lsquo;And a gratuity, whatever you think fit,
      nothing much, of course, should also be handed to her&mdash;the old lady.
      And I on my side will make her understand that she has nothing to fear
      from you, as you are a visitor here, a gentleman&mdash;and of course you
      can understand that this is a secret, and will not in any case get her
      into any unpleasantness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ardalion took the tray in one hand, and with a graceful swing of the tray
      and his own person, turned towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I may reckon upon you!&rsquo; I shouted after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may trust me!&rsquo; I heard his self-satisfied voice say: &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll talk to
      the old woman and transmit you her answer exactly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not enlarge on the train of thought aroused in me by the
      extraordinary fact Ardalion had related; but I am prepared to admit that I
      awaited the promised reply with impatience. Late in the evening Ardalion
      came to me and announced that to his annoyance he could not find the old
      woman. I handed him, however, by way of encouragement, a three-rouble
      note. The next morning he appeared again in my room with a beaming
      countenance; the old woman had consented to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hi! boy!&rsquo; shouted Ardalion in the corridor; &lsquo;Hi! apprentice! Come here!&rsquo; 
      A boy of six came up, grimed all over with soot like a kitten, with a
      shaved head, perfectly bald in places, in a torn, striped smock, and huge
      goloshes on his bare feet. &lsquo;You take the gentleman, you know where,&rsquo; said
      Ardalion, addressing the &lsquo;apprentice,&rsquo; and pointing to me. &lsquo;And you, sir,
      when you arrive, ask for Mastridia Karpovna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy uttered a hoarse grunt, and we set off.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked rather a long while about the unpaved streets of the town of T&mdash;&mdash;;
      at last in one of them, almost the most deserted and desolate of all, my
      guide stopped before an old two-story wooden house, and wiping his nose
      all over his smock-sleeve, said: &lsquo;Here; go to the right.&rsquo; I passed through
      the porch into the outer passage, stumbled towards my right, a low door
      creaked on rusty hinges, and I saw before me a stout old woman in a brown
      jacket lined with hare-skin, with a parti-coloured kerchief on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mastridia Karpovna?&rsquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same, at your service,&rsquo; the old woman replied in a piping voice.
      &lsquo;Please walk in. Won&rsquo;t you take a chair?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The room into which the old woman conducted me was so littered up with
      every sort of rubbish, rags, pillows, feather-beds, sacks, that one could
      hardly turn round in it. The sunlight barely struggled in through two
      dusty little windows; in one corner, from behind a heap of boxes piled on
      one another, there came a feeble whimpering and wailing.... I could not
      tell from what; perhaps a sick baby, or perhaps a puppy. I sat down on a
      chair, and the old woman stood up directly facing me. Her face was yellow,
      half-transparent like wax; her lips were so fallen in that they formed a
      single straight line in the midst of a multitude of wrinkles; a tuft of
      white hair stuck out from below the kerchief on her head, but the sunken
      grey eyes peered out alertly and cleverly from under the bony overhanging
      brow; and the sharp nose fairly stuck out like a spindle, fairly sniffed
      the air as if it would say: I&rsquo;m a smart one! &lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;re no fool!&rsquo; was
      my thought. At the same time she smelt of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      I explained to her the object of my visit, of which, however, as I
      observed, she must be aware. She listened to me, blinked her eyes rapidly,
      and only lifted her nose till it stuck out still more sharply, as though
      she were making ready to peck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure, to be sure,&rsquo; she said at last; &lsquo;Ardalion Matveitch did say
      something, certainly; my son Vassinka&rsquo;s art you were wanting.... But we
      can&rsquo;t be sure, my dear sir....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, why so?&rsquo; I interposed. &lsquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, you may feel
      perfectly easy.... I&rsquo;m not an informer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, mercy on us,&rsquo; the old woman caught me up hurriedly, &lsquo;what do you
      mean? Could we dare to suppose such a thing of your honour! And on what
      ground could one inform against us? Do you suppose it&rsquo;s some sinful
      contrivance of ours? No, sir, my son&rsquo;s not the one to lend himself to
      anything wicked ... or give way to any sort of witchcraft.... God forbid
      indeed, holy Mother of Heaven! (The old woman crossed herself three
      times.) He&rsquo;s the foremost in prayer and fasting in the whole province; the
      foremost, your honour, he is! And that&rsquo;s just it: great grace has been
      vouchsafed to him. Yes, indeed. It&rsquo;s not the work of his hands. It&rsquo;s from
      on high, my dear; so it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you agree?&rsquo; I asked: &lsquo;when can I see your son?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman blinked again and shifted her rolled up handkerchief from
      one sleeve to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, well, sir&mdash;well, sir, I can&rsquo;t say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Allow me, Mastridia Karpovna, to hand you this,&rsquo; I interrupted, and I
      gave her a ten-rouble note.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman clutched it at once in her fat, crooked fingers, which
      recalled the fleshy claws of an owl, quickly slipped it into her sleeve,
      pondered a little, and as though she had suddenly reached a decision,
      slapped her thighs with her open hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come here this evening a little after seven,&rsquo; she said, not in her
      previous voice, but in quite a different one, more solemn and subdued;
      &lsquo;only not to this room, but kindly go straight up to the floor above, and
      you&rsquo;ll find a door to your left, and you open that door; and you&rsquo;ll go,
      your honour, into an empty room, and in that room you&rsquo;ll see a chair. Sit
      you down on that chair and wait; and whatever you see, don&rsquo;t utter a word
      and don&rsquo;t do anything; and please don&rsquo;t speak to my son either; for he&rsquo;s
      but young yet, and he suffers from fits. He&rsquo;s very easily scared; he&rsquo;ll
      tremble and shake like any chicken ... a sad thing it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Mastridia. &lsquo;You say he&rsquo;s young, but since he&rsquo;s your son ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the spirit, sir, in the spirit. Many&rsquo;s the orphan I have under my
      care!&rsquo; she added, wagging her head in the direction of the corner, from
      which came the plaintive whimper. &lsquo;O&mdash;O God Almighty, holy Mother of
      God! And do you, your honour, before you come here, think well which of
      your deceased relations or friends&mdash;the kingdom of Heaven to them!&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      desirous of seeing. Go over your deceased friends, and whichever you
      select, keep him in your mind, keep him all the while till my son comes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, mustn&rsquo;t I tell your son whom ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, nay, sir, not one word. He will find out what he needs in your
      thoughts himself. You&rsquo;ve only to keep your friend thoroughly in mind; and
      at your dinner drink a drop of wine&mdash;just two or three glasses; wine
      never comes amiss.&rsquo; The old woman laughed, licked her lips, passed her
      hand over her mouth, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So at half-past seven?&rsquo; I queried, getting up from my chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At half-past seven, your honour, at half-past seven,&rsquo; Mastridia Karpovna
      replied reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I took leave of the old woman and went back to the hotel. I did not doubt
      that they were going to make a fool of me, but in what way?&mdash;that was
      what excited my curiosity. With Ardalion I did not exchange more than two
      or three words. &lsquo;Did she see you?&rsquo; he asked me, knitting his brow, and on
      my affirmative reply, he exclaimed: &lsquo;The old woman&rsquo;s as good as any
      statesman!&rsquo; I set to work, in accordance with the &lsquo;statesman&rsquo;s&rsquo; counsel,
      to run over my deceased friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      After rather prolonged hesitation I fixed, at last, on an old man who had
      long been dead, a Frenchman, once my tutor. I selected him not because he
      had any special attraction for me; but his whole figure was so original,
      so unlike any figure of to-day, that it would be utterly impossible to
      imitate it. He had an enormous head, fluffy white hair combed straight
      back, thick black eyebrows, a hawk nose, and two large warts of a pinkish
      hue in the middle of the forehead; he used to wear a green frockcoat with
      smooth brass buttons, a striped waistcoat with a stand-up collar, a jabot
      and lace cuffs. &lsquo;If he shows me my old Dessaire,&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;well, I
      shall have to admit that he&rsquo;s a sorcerer!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner I followed the old dame&rsquo;s behest and drank a bottle of Lafitte,
      of the first quality, so Ardalion averred, though it had a very strong
      flavour of burnt cork, and a thick sediment at the bottom of each glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly at half-past seven I stood in front of the house where I had
      conversed with the worthy Mastridia Karpovna. All the shutters of the
      windows were closed, but the door was open. I went into the house, mounted
      the shaky staircase to the first story, and opening a door on the left,
      found myself, as the old woman had said, in a perfectly empty, rather
      large room; a tallow candle set in the window-sill threw a dim light over
      the room; against the wall opposite the door stood a wicker-bottomed
      chair. I snuffed the candle, which had already burnt down enough to form a
      long smouldering wick, sat down on the chair and began to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first ten minutes passed rather quickly; in the room itself there was
      absolutely nothing which could distract my attention, but I listened
      intently to every rustle, looked intently at the closed door.... My heart
      was throbbing. After the first ten minutes followed another ten minutes,
      then half an hour, three-quarters of an hour, and not a stir of any kind
      around! I coughed several times to make my presence known; I began to feel
      bored and out of temper; to be made a fool of in just that way had not
      entered into my calculations. I was on the point of getting up from my
      seat, taking the candle from the window, and going downstairs.... I looked
      at it; the wick again wanted snuffing; but as I turned my eyes from the
      window to the door, I could not help starting; with his back leaning
      against the door stood a man. He had entered so quickly and noiselessly
      that I had heard nothing. He wore a simple blue smock; he was of middle
      height and rather thick-set. With his hands behind his back and his head
      bent, he was staring at me. In the dim light of the candle I could not
      distinctly make out his features. I saw nothing but a shaggy mane of
      matted hair falling on his forehead, and thick, rather drawn lips and
      whitish eyes. I was nearly speaking to him, but I recollected Mastridia&rsquo;s
      injunction, and bit my lips. The man, who had come in, continued to gaze
      at me, and, strange to say, at the same time I felt something like fear,
      and, as though at the word of command, promptly started thinking of my old
      tutor. <i>He</i> still stood at the door and breathed heavily, as though
      he had been climbing a mountain or lifting a weight, while his eyes seemed
      to expand, seemed to come closer to me&mdash;and I felt uncomfortable
      under their obstinate, heavy, menacing stare; at times those eyes glowed
      with a malignant inward fire, a fire such as I have seen in the eyes of a
      pointer dog when it &lsquo;points&rsquo; at a hare; and, like a pointer dog, <i>he</i>
      kept <i>his</i> eyes intently following mine when I &lsquo;tried to double,&rsquo; 
      that is, tried to turn my eyes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed I do not know how long&mdash;perhaps a minute, perhaps a quarter
      of an hour. He still gazed at me; I still experienced a certain discomfort
      and alarm and still thought of the Frenchman. Twice I tried to say to
      myself, &lsquo;What nonsense! what a farce!&rsquo; I tried to smile, to shrug my
      shoulders.... It was no use! All initiative had all at once &lsquo;frozen up&rsquo; 
      within me&mdash;I can find no other word for it. I was overcome by a sort
      of numbness. Suddenly I noticed that he had left the door, and was
      standing a step or two nearer to me; then he gave a slight bound, both
      feet together, and stood closer still.... Then again ... and again; while
      the menacing eyes were simply fastened on my whole face, and the hands
      remained behind, and the broad chest heaved painfully. These leaps struck
      me as ridiculous, but I felt dread too, and what I could not understand at
      all, a drowsiness began suddenly to come upon me. My eyelids clung
      together ... the shaggy figure with the whitish eyes in the blue smock
      seemed double before me, and suddenly vanished altogether! ... I shook
      myself; he was again standing between the door and me, but now much
      nearer.... Then he vanished again&mdash;a sort of mist seemed to fall upon
      him; again he appeared ... vanished again ... appeared again, and always
      closer, closer ... his hard, almost gasping breathing floated across to me
      now.... Again the mist fell, and all of a sudden out of this mist the head
      of old Dessaire began to take distinct shape, beginning with the white,
      brushed-back hair! Yes: there were his warts, his black eyebrows, his hook
      nose! There too his green coat with the brass buttons, the striped
      waistcoat and jabot.... I shrieked, I got up.... The old man vanished, and
      in his place I saw again the man in the blue smock. He moved staggering to
      the wall, leaned his head and both arms against it, and heaving like an
      over-loaded horse, in a husky voice said, &lsquo;Tea!&rsquo; Mastridia Karpovna&mdash;how
      she came there I can&rsquo;t say&mdash;flew to him and saying: &lsquo;Vassinka!
      Vassinka!&rsquo; began anxiously wiping away the sweat, which simply trickled
      from his face and hair. I was on the point of approaching her, but she, so
      insistently, in such a heart-rending voice cried: &lsquo;Your honour! merciful
      sir! have pity on us, go away, for Christ&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; that I obeyed, while
      she turned again to her son. &lsquo;Bread-winner, darling,&rsquo; she murmured
      soothingly: &lsquo;you shall have tea directly, directly. And you too, sir, had
      better take a cup of tea at home!&rsquo; she shouted after me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got home I obeyed Mastridia and ordered some tea; I felt tired&mdash;even
      weak. &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; Ardalion questioned me, &lsquo;have you been? did you see
      something?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did, certainly, show me something ... which, I&rsquo;ll own, I had not
      anticipated,&rsquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a man of marvellous power,&rsquo; observed Ardalion, carrying off the
      samovar; &lsquo;he is held in high esteem among the merchant gentry.&rsquo; As I went
      to bed, and reflected on the incident that had occurred to me, I fancied
      at last that I had reached some explanation of it. The man doubtless
      possessed a considerable magnetic power; acting by some means, which I did
      not understand of course, upon my nerves, he had evoked within me so
      vividly, so definitely, the image of the old man of whom I was thinking,
      that at last I fancied that I saw him before my eyes.... Such
      &lsquo;metastases,&rsquo; such transferences of sensation, are recognised by science.
      It was all very well; but the force capable of producing such effects
      still remained, something marvellous and mysterious. &lsquo;Say what you will,&rsquo; 
      I thought, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen, seen with my own eyes, my dead tutor!&rsquo; 
    </p>

      The next day the ball in the Hall of Nobility took place. Sophia&rsquo;s father
      called on me and reminded me of the engagement I had made with his
      daughter. At ten o&rsquo;clock I was standing by her side in the middle of a
      ballroom lighted up by a number of copper lamps, and was preparing to
      execute the not very complicated steps of the French quadrille to the
      resounding blare of the military band. Crowds of people were there; the
      ladies were especially numerous and very pretty; but the first place among
      them would certainly have been given to my partner, if it had not been for
      the rather strange, even rather wild look in her eyes. I noticed that she
      hardly ever blinked; the unmistakable expression of sincerity in her eyes
      did not make up for what was extraordinary in them. But she had a charming
      figure, and moved gracefully, though with constraint. When she waltzed,
      and, throwing herself a little back, bent her slender neck towards her
      right shoulder, as though she wanted to get away from her partner, nothing
      more touchingly youthful and pure could be imagined. She was all in white,
      with a turquoise cross on a black ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked her for a mazurka, and tried to talk to her. But her answers were
      few and reluctant, though she listened attentively, with the same
      expression of dreamy absorption which had struck me when I first met her.
      Not the slightest trace of desire to please, at her age, with her
      appearance, and the absence of a smile, and those eyes, continually fixed
      directly upon the eyes of the person speaking to her, though they seemed
      at the same time to see something else, to be absorbed with something
      different.... What a strange creature! Not knowing, at last, how to thaw
      her, I bethought me of telling her of my adventure of the previous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard me to the end with evident interest, but was not, as I had
      expected, surprised at what I told her, and merely asked whether he was
      not called Vassily. I recollected that the old woman had called him
      &lsquo;Vassinka.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, his name is Vassily,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;do you know him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a saintly man living here called Vassily,&rsquo; she observed; &lsquo;I
      wondered whether it was he.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Saintliness has nothing to do with this,&rsquo; I remarked; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s simply the
      action of magnetism&mdash;a fact of interest for doctors and students of
      science.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I proceeded to expound my views on the peculiar force called magnetism, on
      the possibility of one man&rsquo;s will being brought under the influence of
      another&rsquo;s will, and so on; but my explanations&mdash;which were, it is
      true, somewhat confused&mdash;seemed to make no impression on her. Sophie
      listened, dropping her clasped hands on her knees with a fan lying
      motionless in them; she did not play with it, she did not move her fingers
      at all, and I felt that all my words rebounded from her as from a statue
      of stone. She heard them, but clearly she had her own convictions, which
      nothing could shake or uproot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can hardly admit miracles!&rsquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I admit them,&rsquo; she answered calmly. &lsquo;And how can one help
      admitting them? Are not we told in the gospel that who has but a grain of
      faith as big as a mustard seed, he can remove mountains? One need only
      have faith&mdash;there will be miracles!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems there is very little faith nowadays,&rsquo; I observed; &lsquo;anyway, one
      doesn&rsquo;t hear of miracles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But yet there are miracles; you have seen one yourself. No; faith is not
      dead nowadays; and the beginning of faith ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom,&rsquo; I interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The beginning of faith,&rsquo; pursued Sophie, nothing daunted, &lsquo;is
      self-abasement ... humiliation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humiliation even?&rsquo; I queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. The pride of man, haughtiness, presumption&mdash;that is what must
      be utterly rooted up. You spoke of the will&mdash;that&rsquo;s what must be
      broken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I scanned the whole figure of the young girl who was uttering such
      sentences.... &lsquo;My word, the child&rsquo;s in earnest, too,&rsquo; was my thought. I
      glanced at our neighbours in the mazurka; they, too, glanced at me, and I
      fancied that my astonishment amused them; one of them even smiled at me
      sympathetically, as though he would say: &lsquo;Well, what do you think of our
      queer young lady? every one here knows what she&rsquo;s like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you tried to break your will?&rsquo; I said, turning to Sophie again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every one is bound to do what he thinks right,&rsquo; she answered in a
      dogmatic tone. &lsquo;Let me ask you,&rsquo; I began, after a brief silence, &lsquo;do you
      believe in the possibility of calling up the dead?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophie softly shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are no dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are no dead souls; they are undying and can always appear, when
      they like.... They are always about us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? Do you suppose, for instance, that an immortal soul may be at this
      moment hovering about that garrison major with the red nose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not? The sunlight falls on him and his nose, and is not the sunlight,
      all light, from God? And what does external appearance matter? To the pure
      all things are pure! Only to find a teacher, to find a leader!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But excuse me, excuse me,&rsquo; I put in, not, I must own, without malicious
      intent. &lsquo;You want a leader ... but what is your priest for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophie looked coldly at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean to laugh at me, I suppose. My priestly father tells me what I
      ought to do; but what I want is a leader who would show me himself in
      action how to sacrifice one&rsquo;s self!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes towards the ceiling. With her childlike face, and that
      expression of immobile absorption, of secret, continual perplexity, she
      reminded me of the pre-raphaelite Madonnas....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have read somewhere,&rsquo; she went on, not turning to me, and hardly moving
      her lips, &lsquo;of a grand person who directed that he should be buried under a
      church porch so that all the people who came in should tread him under
      foot and trample on him.... That is what one ought to do in life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Boom! boom! tra-ra-ra! thundered the drums from the band.... I must own
      such a conversation at a ball struck me as eccentric in the extreme; the
      ideas involuntarily kindled within me were of a nature anything but
      religious. I took advantage of my partner&rsquo;s being invited to one of the
      figures of the mazurka to avoid renewing our quasi-theological discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later I conducted Mademoiselle Sophie to her father,
      and two days after I left the town of T&mdash;&mdash;, and the image of
      the girl with the childlike face and the soul impenetrable as stone
      slipped quickly out of my memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years passed, and it chanced that that image was recalled again to me.
      It was like this: I was talking to a colleague who had just returned from
      a tour in South Russia. He had spent some time in the town of T&mdash;&mdash;,
      and told me various items of news about the neighbourhood. &lsquo;By the way!&rsquo; 
      he exclaimed, &lsquo;you knew V. G. B. very well, I fancy, didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I know him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And his daughter Sophia, do you know her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her twice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only fancy, she&rsquo;s run away!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Three months ago she disappeared, and nothing&rsquo;s been
      heard of her. And the astonishing thing is no one can make out whom she&rsquo;s
      run off with. Fancy, they&rsquo;ve not the slightest idea, not the smallest
      suspicion! She&rsquo;d refused all the offers made her, and she was most proper
      in her behaviour. Ah, these quiet, religious girls are the ones! It&rsquo;s made
      an awful scandal all over the province! B.&lsquo;s in despair.... And whatever
      need had she to run away? Her father carried out her wishes in everything.
      And what&rsquo;s so unaccountable, all the Lovelaces of the province are there
      all right, not one&rsquo;s missing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And they&rsquo;ve not found her up till now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you she might as well be at the bottom of the sea! It&rsquo;s one rich
      heiress less in the world, that&rsquo;s the worst of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This piece of news greatly astonished me. It did not seem at all in
      keeping with the recollection I had of Sophia B. But there! anything may
      happen.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In the autumn of the same year fate brought me&mdash;again on official
      business&mdash;into the S&mdash;&mdash; province, which is, as every one
      knows, next to the province of T&mdash;&mdash;. It was cold and rainy
      weather; the worn-out posting-horses could scarcely drag my light trap
      through the black slush of the highroad. One day, I remember, was
      particularly unlucky: three times we got &lsquo;stuck&rsquo; in the mud up to the
      axles of the wheels; my driver was continually giving up one rut and with
      moans and grunts trudging across to the other, and finding things no
      better with that. In fact, towards evening I was so exhausted that on
      reaching the posting-station I decided to spend the night at the inn. I
      was given a room with a broken-down wooden sofa, a sloping floor, and torn
      paper on the walls; there was a smell in it of kvas, bast-mats, onions,
      and even turpentine, and swarms of flies were on everything; but at any
      rate I could find shelter there from the weather, and the rain had set in,
      as they say, for the whole day. I ordered a samovar to be brought, and,
      sitting on the sofa, settled down to those cheerless wayside reflections
      so familiar to travellers in Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were broken in upon by a heavy knocking that came from the common
      room, from which my room was separated by a deal partition. This sound was
      accompanied by an intermittent metallic jingle, like the clank of chains,
      and a coarse male voice boomed out suddenly: &lsquo;The blessing of God on all
      within this house. The blessing of God! the blessing of God! Amen, amen!
      Scatter His enemies!&rsquo; repeated the voice, with a sort of incongruous and
      savage drawl on the last syllable of each word.... A noisy sigh was heard,
      and a ponderous body sank on to the bench with the same jingling sound.
      &lsquo;Akulina! servant of God, come here!&rsquo; the voice began again: &lsquo;Behold!
      Clothed in rags and blessed! ... Ha-ha-ha! Tfoo! Merciful God, merciful
      God, merciful God!&rsquo; the voice droned like a deacon in the choir. &lsquo;Merciful
      God, Creator of my body, behold my iniquity.... O-ho-ho! Ha-ha! ... Tfoo!
      And all abundance be to this house in the seventh hour!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; I asked the hospitable landlady, who came in with the
      samovar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That, your honour,&rsquo; she answered me in a hurried whisper, &lsquo;is a blessed,
      holy man. He&rsquo;s not long come into our parts; and here he&rsquo;s graciously
      pleased to visit us. In such weather! The wet&rsquo;s simply trickling from him,
      poor dear man, in streams! And you should see the chains on him&mdash;such
      a lot!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The blessing of God! the blessing of God!&rsquo; the voice was heard again.
      &lsquo;Akulina! Hey, Akulina! Akulinushka&mdash;friend! where is our paradise?
      Our fair paradise of bliss? In the wilderness is our paradise, ...
      para-dise.... And to this house, from beginning of time, great happiness,
      ... o ... o ... o ...&rsquo; The voice muttered something inarticulate, and
      again, after a protracted yawn, there came the hoarse laugh. This laugh
      broke out every time, as it were, involuntarily, and every time it was
      followed by vigorous spitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, me! Stepanitch isn&rsquo;t here! That&rsquo;s the worst of it!&rsquo; the landlady
      said, as it were to herself, as she stood with every sign of the
      profoundest attention at the door. &lsquo;He will say some word of salvation,
      and I, foolish woman, may not catch it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In the partition there was a chink; I applied my eye to it. The crazy
      pilgrim was sitting on a bench with his back to me; I saw nothing but his
      shaggy head, as huge as a beer-can, and a broad bent back in a patched and
      soaking shirt. Before him, on the earth floor, knelt a frail-looking woman
      in a jacket, such as are worn by women of the artisan class&mdash;old and
      wet through&mdash;and with a dark kerchief pulled down almost over her
      eyes. She was trying to pull the holy man&rsquo;s boots off; her fingers slid
      off the greasy, slippery leather. The landlady was standing near her, with
      her arms folded across her bosom, gazing reverently at the &lsquo;man of God.&rsquo; 
      He was, as before, mumbling some inarticulate words.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the woman succeeded in tugging off the boots. She almost fell
      backwards, but recovered herself, and began unwinding the strips of rag
      which were wrapped round the vagrant&rsquo;s legs. On the sole of his foot there
      was a wound.... I turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A cup of tea wouldn&rsquo;t you bid me get you, my dear?&rsquo; I heard the hostess
      saying in an obsequious voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a notion!&rsquo; responded the holy man. &lsquo;To indulge the sinful body....
      O-ho-ho! Break all the bones in it ... but she talks of tea! Oh, oh,
      worthy old woman, Satan is strong within us.... Fight him with hunger,
      fight him with cold, with the sluice-gates of heaven, the pouring,
      penetrating rain, and he takes no harm&mdash;he is alive still! Remember
      the day of the Intercession of the Mother of God! You will receive, you
      will receive in abundance!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady could not resist uttering a faint groan of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only listen to me! Give all thou hast, give thy head, give thy shirt! If
      they ask not of thee, yet give! For God is all-seeing! Is it hard for Him
      to destroy your roof? He has given thee bread in His mercy, and do thou
      bake it in the oven! He seeth all! Se ... e ... eth! Whose eye is in the
      triangle? Say, whose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady stealthily crossed herself under her neckerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old enemy is adamant! A ... da ... mant! A ... da ... mant!&rsquo; the
      religious maniac repeated several times, gnashing his teeth. &lsquo;The old
      serpent! But God will arise! Yes, God will arise and scatter His enemies!
      I will call up all the dead! I will go against His enemy.... Ha-ha-ha!
      Tfoo!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you any oil?&rsquo; said another voice, hardly audible; &lsquo;let me put some
      on the wound.... I have got a clean rag.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I peeped through the chink again; the woman in the jacket was still busied
      with the vagrant&rsquo;s sore foot.... &lsquo;A Magdalen!&rsquo; I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get it directly, my dear,&rsquo; said the woman, and, coming into my room,
      she took a spoonful of oil from the lamp burning before the holy picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that waiting on him?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t know, sir, who it is; she too, I suppose, is seeking salvation,
      atoning for her sins. But what a saintly man he is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Akulinushka, my sweet child, my dear daughter,&rsquo; the crazy pilgrim was
      repeating meanwhile, and he suddenly burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman kneeling before him lifted her eyes to him.... Heavens! where
      had I seen those eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady went up to her with the spoonful of oil. She finished her
      operation, and, getting up from the floor, asked if there were a clean
      loft and a little hay.... &lsquo;Vassily Nikititch likes to sleep on hay,&rsquo; she
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure there is, come this way,&rsquo; answered the woman; &lsquo;come this way,
      my dear,&rsquo; she turned to the holy man, &lsquo;and dry yourself and rest.&rsquo; The man
      coughed, slowly got up from the bench&mdash;his chains clanked again&mdash;and
      turning round with his face to me, looked for the holy pictures, and began
      crossing himself with a wide movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recognised him instantly: it was the very artisan Vassily, who had once
      shown me my dead tutor!
    </p>
    <p>
      His features were little changed; only their expression had become still
      more unusual, still more terrible.... The lower part of his swollen face
      was overgrown with unkempt beard. Tattered, filthy, wild-looking, he
      inspired in me more repugnance than horror. He left off crossing himself,
      but still his eyes wandered senselessly about the corners of the room,
      about the floor, as though he were waiting for something....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vassily Nikititch, please come,&rsquo; said the woman in the jacket with a bow.
      He suddenly threw up his head and turned round, but stumbled and
      tottered.... His companion flew to him at once, and supported him under
      the arm. Judging by her voice and figure, she seemed still young; her face
      it was almost impossible to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Akulinushka, friend!&rsquo; the vagrant repeated once more in a shaking voice,
      and opening his mouth wide, and smiting himself on the breast with his
      fist, he uttered a deep groan, that seemed to come from the bottom of his
      heart. Both followed the landlady out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay down on my hard sofa and mused a long while on what I had seen. My
      mesmeriser had become a regular religious maniac. This was what he had
      been brought to by the power which one could not but recognise in him!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning I was preparing to go on my way. The rain was falling as
      fast as the day before, but I could not delay any longer. My servant, as
      he gave me water to wash, wore a special smile on his face, a smile of
      restrained irony. I knew that smile well; it indicated that my servant had
      heard something discreditable or even shocking about gentlefolks. He was
      obviously burning with impatience to communicate it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what is it?&rsquo; I asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did your honour see the crazy pilgrim yesterday?&rsquo; my man began at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; what then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And did you see his companion too?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I saw her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a young lady, of noble family.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the truth I&rsquo;m telling you; some merchants arrived here this morning
      from T&mdash;&mdash;; they recognised her. They did tell me her name, but
      I&rsquo;ve forgotten it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a flash of enlightenment. &lsquo;Is the pilgrim still here?&rsquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fancy he&rsquo;s not gone yet. He&rsquo;s been ever so long at the gate, and making
      such a wonderful wise to-do, that there&rsquo;s no getting by. He&rsquo;s amusing
      himself with this tomfoolery; he finds it pay, no doubt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My man belonged to the same class of educated servants as Ardalion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And is the lady with him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. She&rsquo;s in attendance on him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I went out on to the steps, and got a view of the crazy pilgrim. He was
      sitting on a bench at the gate, and, bent down with both his open hands
      pressed on it, he was shaking his drooping head from right to left, for
      all the world like a wild beast in a cage. The thick mane of curly hair
      covered his eyes, and shook from side to side, and so did his pendulous
      lips.... A strange, almost unhuman muttering came from them. His companion
      had only just finished washing from a pitcher that was hanging on a pole,
      and without having yet replaced her kerchief on her head, was making her
      way back to the gate along a narrow plank laid across the dark puddles of
      the filthy yard. I glanced at her head, which was now entirely uncovered,
      and positively threw up my hands with astonishment: before me stood Sophie
      B.!
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned quickly round and fixed upon me her blue eyes, immovable as
      ever. She was much thinner, her skin looked coarser and had the
      yellowish-ruddy tinge of sunburn, her nose was sharper, and her lips were
      harder in their lines. But she was not less good-looking; only besides her
      old expression of dreamy amazement there was now a different look&mdash;resolute,
      almost bold, intense and exalted. There was not a trace of childishness
      left in the face now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to her. &lsquo;Sophia Vladimirovna,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;can it be you? In such
      a dress ... in such company....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, looked still more intently at me, as though anxious to find
      out who was speaking to her, and, without saying a word to me, fairly
      rushed to her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Akulinushka,&rsquo; he faltered, with a heavy sigh, &lsquo;our sins, sins ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vassily Nikititch, let us go at once! Do you hear, at once, at once,&rsquo; she
      said, pulling her kerchief on to her forehead with one hand, while with
      the other she supported the pilgrim under the elbow; &lsquo;let us go, Vassily
      Nikititch: there is danger here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m coming, my good girl, I&rsquo;m coming,&rsquo; the crazy pilgrim responded
      obediently, and, bending his whole body forward, he got up from the seat.
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s only this chain to fasten....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I once more approached Sophia, and told her my name. I began beseeching
      her to listen to me, to say one word to me. I pointed to the rain, which
      was coming down in bucketsful. I begged her to have some care for her
      health, the health of her companion. I mentioned her father.... But she
      seemed possessed by a sort of wrathful, a sort of vindictive excitement:
      without paying the slightest attention to me, setting her teeth and
      breathing hard, she urged on the distracted vagrant in an undertone, in
      soft insistent words, girt him up, fastened on his chains, pulled on to
      his hair a child&rsquo;s cloth cap with a broken peak, stuck his staff in his
      hand, slung a wallet on her own shoulder, and went with him out at the
      gate into the street.... To stop her actually I had not the right, and it
      would have been of no use; and at my last despairing call she did not even
      turn round. Supporting the &lsquo;man of God&rsquo; under his arm, she stepped rapidly
      over the black mud of the street; and in a few moments, across the dim
      dusk of the foggy morning, through the thick network of falling raindrops,
      I saw the last glimpse of the two figures, the crazy pilgrim and
      Sophie.... They turned the corner of a projecting hut, and vanished for
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to my room. I fell to pondering. I could not understand it; I
      could not understand how such a girl, well brought up, young, and wealthy,
      could throw up everything and every one, her own home, her family, her
      friends, break with all her habits, with all the comforts of life, and for
      what? To follow a half-insane vagrant, to become his servant! I could not
      for an instant entertain the idea that the explanation of such a step was
      to be found in any prompting, however depraved, of the heart, in love or
      passion.... One had but to glance at the repulsive figure of the &lsquo;man of
      God&rsquo; to dismiss such a notion entirely! No, Sophie had remained pure; and
      to her all things were pure; I could not understand what Sophie had done;
      but I did not blame her, as, later on, I have not blamed other girls who
      too have sacrificed everything for what they thought the truth, for what
      they held to be their vocation. I could not help regretting that Sophie
      had chosen just <i>that</i> path; but also I could not refuse her
      admiration, respect even. In good earnest she had talked of
      self-sacrifice, of abasement ... in <i>her</i>, words were not opposed to
      acts. She had sought a leader, a guide, and had found him, ... and, my
      God, what a guide!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she had lain down to be trampled, trodden under foot.... In the
      process of time, a rumour reached me that her family had succeeded at last
      in finding out the lost sheep, and bringing her home. But at home she did
      not live long, and died, like a &lsquo;Sister of Silence,&rsquo; without having spoken
      a word to any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace to your heart, poor, enigmatic creature! Vassily Nikititch is
      probably on his crazy wanderings still; the iron health of such people is
      truly marvellous. Perhaps, though, his epilepsy may have done for him.

    <p>
      ... I am old and ill now, and my thoughts brood oftenest upon death, every
      day coming nearer; rarely I think of the past, rarely I turn the eyes of
      my soul behind me. Only from time to time&mdash;in winter, as I sit
      motionless before the glowing fire, in summer, as I pace with slow tread
      along the shady avenue&mdash;I recall past years, events, faces; but it is
      not on my mature years nor on my youth that my thoughts rest at such
      times. They either carry me back to my earliest childhood, or to the first
      years of boyhood. Now, for instance, I see myself in the country with my
      stern and wrathful grandmother&mdash;I was only twelve&mdash;and two
      figures rise up before my imagination....

    <p>
      The old footman Filippitch came in, on tiptoe, as usual, with a cravat
      tied up in a rosette, with tightly compressed lips, &lsquo;lest his breath
      should be smelt,&rsquo; with a grey tuft of hair standing up in the very middle
      of his forehead. He came in, bowed, and handed my grandmother on an iron
      tray a large letter with an heraldic seal. My grandmother put on her
      spectacles, read the letter through....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he here?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is my lady pleased ...&rsquo; Filippitch began timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Imbecile! The man who brought the letter&mdash;is he here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is here, to be sure he is.... He is sitting in the counting-house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother rattled her amber rosary beads....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell him to come to me.... And you, sir,&rsquo; she turned to me, &lsquo;sit still.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, I was sitting perfectly still in my corner, on the stool
      assigned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother kept me well in hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later there came into the room a man of five-and-thirty,
      black-haired and swarthy, with broad cheek-bones, a face marked with
      smallpox, a hook nose, and thick eyebrows, from under which the small grey
      eyes looked out with mournful composure. The colour of the eyes and their
      expression were out of keeping with the Oriental cast of the rest of the
      face. The man was dressed in a decent, long-skirted coat. He stopped in
      the doorway, and bowed&mdash;only with his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So your name&rsquo;s Baburin?&rsquo; queried my grandmother, and she added to
      herself: &lsquo;<i>Il a l&rsquo;air d&rsquo;un arménien.</i>&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it is,&rsquo; the man answered in a deep and even voice. At the first
      brusque sound of my grandmother&rsquo;s voice his eyebrows faintly quivered.
      Surely he had not expected her to address him as an equal?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you a Russian? orthodox?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother took off her spectacles, and scanned Baburin from head to
      foot deliberately. He did not drop his eyes, he merely folded his hands
      behind his back. What particularly struck my fancy was his beard; it was
      very smoothly shaven, but such blue cheeks and chin I had never seen in my
      life!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yakov Petrovitch,&rsquo; began my grandmother, &lsquo;recommends you strongly in his
      letter as sober and industrious; why, then, did you leave his service?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He needs a different sort of person to manage his estate, madam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A different ... sort? That I don&rsquo;t quite understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother rattled her beads again. &lsquo;Yakov Petrovitch writes to me
      that there are two peculiarities about you. What peculiarities?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Baburin shrugged his shoulders slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell what he sees fit to call peculiarities. Possibly that I ...
      don&rsquo;t allow corporal punishment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother was surprised. &lsquo;Do you mean to say Yakov Petrovitch wanted
      to flog you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Baburin&rsquo;s swarthy face grew red to the roots of his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not understood me right, madam. I make it a rule not to employ
      corporal punishment ... with the peasants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother was more surprised than ever; she positively threw up her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; she pronounced at last, and putting her head a little on one side,
      once more she scrutinised Baburin attentively. &lsquo;So that&rsquo;s your rule, is
      it? Well, that&rsquo;s of no consequence whatever to me; I don&rsquo;t want an
      overseer, but a counting-house clerk, a secretary. What sort of a hand do
      you write?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I write well, without mistakes in spelling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That too is of no consequence to me. The great thing for me is for it to
      be clear, and without any of those new copybook letters with tails, that I
      don&rsquo;t like. And what&rsquo;s your other peculiarity?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Baburin moved uneasily, coughed....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps ... the gentleman has referred to the fact that I am not alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are married?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no ... but ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother knit her brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a person living with me ... of the male sex ... a comrade, a
      poor friend, from whom I have never parted ... for ... let me see ... ten
      years now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A relation of yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not a relation&mdash;a friend. As to work, there can be no possible
      hindrance occasioned by him,&rsquo; Baburin made haste to add, as though
      foreseeing objections. &lsquo;He lives at my cost, occupies the same room with
      me; he is more likely to be of use, as he is well educated&mdash;speaking
      without flattery, extremely so, in fact&mdash;and his morals are
      exemplary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother heard Baburin out, chewing her lips and half closing her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He lives at your expense?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You keep him out of charity?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As an act of justice ... as it&rsquo;s the duty of one poor man to help another
      poor man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed! It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve heard that. I had supposed till now that
      that was rather the duty of rich people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the rich, if I may venture to say so, it is an entertainment ... but
      for such as we ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, that&rsquo;s enough, that&rsquo;s enough,&rsquo; my grandmother cut him short;
      and after a moment&rsquo;s thought she queried, speaking through her nose, which
      was always a bad sign, &lsquo;And what age is he, your protégé?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About my own age.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, I imagined that you were bringing him up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so; he is my comrade&mdash;and besides ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rsquo; my grandmother cut him short a second time. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a
      philanthropist, it seems. Yakov Petrovitch is right; for a man in your
      position it&rsquo;s something very peculiar. But now let&rsquo;s get to business. I&rsquo;ll
      explain to you what your duties will be. And as regards wages.... <i>Que
      faites vous ici?</i>&rsquo; added my grandmother suddenly, turning her dry,
      yellow face to me:&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Allez étudier votre devoir de mythologie.</i>&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I jumped up, went up to kiss my grandmother&rsquo;s hand, and went out,&mdash;not
      to study mythology, but simply into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The garden on my grandmother&rsquo;s estate was very old and large, and was
      bounded on one side by a flowing pond, in which there were not only plenty
      of carp and eels, but even loach were caught, those renowned loach, that
      have nowadays disappeared almost everywhere. At the head of this pond was
      a thick clump of willows; further and higher, on both sides of a rising
      slope, were dense bushes of hazel, elder, honeysuckle, and sloe-thorn,
      with an undergrowth of heather and clover flowers. Here and there between
      the bushes were tiny clearings, covered with emerald-green, silky, fine
      grass, in the midst of which squat funguses peeped out with their comical,
      variegated pink, lilac, and straw-coloured caps, and golden balls of
      &lsquo;hen-dazzle&rsquo; blazed in light patches. Here in spring-time the nightingales
      sang, the blackbirds whistled, the cuckoos called; here in the heat of
      summer it was always cool&mdash;and I loved to make my way into the
      wilderness and thicket, where I had favourite secret spots, known&mdash;so,
      at least, I imagined&mdash;only to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      On coming out of my grandmother&rsquo;s room I made straight for one of these
      spots, which I had named &lsquo;Switzerland.&rsquo; But what was my astonishment when,
      before I had reached &lsquo;Switzerland,&rsquo; I perceived through the delicate
      network of half-dry twigs and green branches that some one besides me had
      found it out! A long, long figure in a long, loose coat of yellow frieze
      and a tall cap was standing in the very spot I loved best of all! I stole
      up a little nearer, and made out the face, which was utterly unknown to
      me, also very long and soft, with small reddish eyes, and a very funny
      nose; drawn out as long as a pod of peas, it positively over-hung the full
      lips; and these lips, quivering and forming a round O, were giving vent to
      a shrill little whistle, while the long fingers of the bony hands, placed
      facing one another on the upper part of the chest, were rapidly moving
      with a rotatory action. From time to time the motion of the hands
      subsided, the lips ceased whistling and quivering, the head was bent
      forward as though listening. I came still nearer, examined him still more
      closely.... The stranger held in each hand a small flat cup, such as
      people use to tease canaries and make them sing. A twig snapped under my
      feet; the stranger started, turned his dim little eyes towards the copse,
      and was staggering away ... but he stumbled against a tree, uttered an
      exclamation, and stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came out into the open space. The stranger smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morning,&rsquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morning, little master!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not like his calling me little master. Such familiarity!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you doing here?&rsquo; I asked sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, look here,&rsquo; he responded, never leaving off smiling, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m calling
      the little birds to sing.&rsquo; He showed me his little cups. &lsquo;The chaffinches
      answer splendidly! You, at your tender years, take delight, no doubt, in
      the feathered songsters&rsquo; notes! Listen, I beg; I will begin chirping, and
      they&rsquo;ll answer me directly&mdash;it&rsquo;s so delightful!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He began rubbing his little cups. A chaffinch actually did chirp in
      response from a mountain ash near. The stranger laughed without a sound,
      and winked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laugh and the wink&mdash;every gesture of the stranger, his weak,
      lisping voice, his bent knees and thin hands, his very cap and long frieze
      coat&mdash;everything about him suggested good-nature, something innocent
      and droll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you been here long?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, aren&rsquo;t you the person of whom ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Baburin spoke to the lady here. The same, the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your friend&rsquo;s name&rsquo;s Baburin, and what&rsquo;s yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Punin. Punin&rsquo;s my name; Punin. He&rsquo;s Baburin and I&rsquo;m Punin.&rsquo; He set
      the little cups humming again. &lsquo;Listen, listen to the chaffinch.... How it
      carols!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This queer creature took my fancy &lsquo;awfully&rsquo; all at once. Like almost all
      boys, I was either timid or consequential with strangers, but I felt with
      this man as if I had known him for ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along with me,&rsquo; I said to him; &lsquo;I know a place better than this;
      there&rsquo;s a seat there; we can sit down, and we can see the dam from there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means let us go,&rsquo; my new friend responded in his singing voice. I
      let him pass before me. As he walked he rolled from side to side, tripped
      over his own feet, and his head fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed on the back of his coat, under the collar, there hung a small
      tassel. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got hanging there?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; he questioned, and he put his hand up to the collar to feel. &lsquo;Ah,
      the tassel? Let it be! I suppose it was sewn there for ornament! It&rsquo;s not
      in the way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I led him to the seat, and sat down; he settled himself beside me. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      lovely here!&rsquo; he commented, and he drew a deep, deep sigh. &lsquo;Oh, how
      lovely! You have a most splendid garden! Oh, o&mdash;oh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him from one side. &lsquo;What a queer cap you&rsquo;ve got!&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t
      help exclaiming. &lsquo;Show it me here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means, little master, by all means.&rsquo; He took off the cap; I was
      holding out my hand, but I raised my eyes, and&mdash;simply burst out
      laughing. Punin was completely bald; not a single hair was to be seen on
      the high conical skull, covered with smooth white skin. He passed his open
      hand over it, and he too laughed. When he laughed he seemed, as it were,
      to gulp, he opened his mouth wide, closed his eyes&mdash;and vertical
      wrinkles flitted across his forehead in three rows, like waves. &lsquo;Eh,&rsquo; said
      he at last, &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t it quite like an egg?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, exactly like an egg!&rsquo; I agreed with enthusiasm. &lsquo;And have you
      been like that long?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, a long while; but what hair I used to have!&mdash;A golden fleece
      like that for which the Argonauts sailed over the watery deeps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I was only twelve, yet, thanks to my mythological studies, I knew
      who the Argonauts were; I was the more surprised at hearing the name on
      the lips of a man dressed almost in rags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must have learned mythology, then?&rsquo; I queried, as I twisted his cap
      over and over in my hands. It turned out to be wadded, with a
      mangy-looking fur trimming, and a broken cardboard peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have studied that subject, my dear little master; I&rsquo;ve had time enough
      for everything in my life! But now restore to me my covering, it is a
      protection to the nakedness of my head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He put on the cap, and, with a downward slope of his whitish eyebrows,
      asked me who I was, and who were my parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the grandson of the lady who owns this place,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;I live
      alone with her. Papa and mamma are dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin crossed himself. &lsquo;May the kingdom of heaven be theirs! So then,
      you&rsquo;re an orphan; and the heir, too. The noble blood in you is visible at
      once; it fairly sparkles in your eyes, and plays like this ... sh ... sh
      ... sh ...&rsquo; He represented with his fingers the play of the blood. &lsquo;Well,
      and do you know, your noble honour, whether my friend has come to terms
      with your grandmamma, whether he has obtained the situation he was
      promised?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin cleared his throat. &lsquo;Ah! if one could be settled here, if only for a
      while! Or else one may wander and wander far, and find not a place to rest
      one&rsquo;s head; the disquieting alarms of life are unceasing, the soul is
      confounded....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me,&rsquo; I interrupted: &lsquo;are you of the clerical profession?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin turned to me and half closed his eyelids. &lsquo;And what may be the cause
      of that question, gentle youth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you talk so&mdash;well, as they read in church.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I use the old scriptural forms of expression? But that ought not
      to surprise you. Admitting that in ordinary conversation such forms of
      expression are not always in place; but when one soars on the wings of
      inspiration, at once the language too grows more exalted. Surely your
      teacher&mdash;the professor of Russian literature&mdash;you do have
      lessons in that, I suppose?&mdash;surely he teaches you that, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he doesn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; I responded. &lsquo;When we stay in the country I have no
      teacher. In Moscow I have a great many teachers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And will you be staying long in the country?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two months, not longer; grandmother says that I&rsquo;m spoilt in the country,
      though I have a governess even here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A French governess?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin scratched behind his ear. &lsquo;A mamselle, that&rsquo;s to say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; she&rsquo;s called Mademoiselle Friquet.&rsquo; I suddenly felt it disgraceful
      for me, a boy of twelve, to have not a tutor, but a governess, like a
      little girl! &lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t mind her,&rsquo; I added contemptuously. &lsquo;What do I
      care!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin shook his head. &lsquo;Ah, you gentlefolk, you gentlefolk! you&rsquo;re too fond
      of foreigners! You have turned away from what is Russian,&mdash;towards
      all that&rsquo;s strange. You&rsquo;ve turned your hearts to those that come from
      foreign parts....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hullo! Are you talking in verse?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and why not? I can do that always, as much as you please; for it
      comes natural to me....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that very instant there sounded in the garden behind us a loud and
      shrill whistle. My new acquaintance hurriedly got up from the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, little sir; that&rsquo;s my friend calling me, looking for me....
      What has he to tell me? Good-bye&mdash;excuse me....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He plunged into the bushes and vanished, while I sat on some time longer
      on the seat. I felt perplexity and another feeling, rather an agreeable
      one ... I had never met nor spoken to any one like this before. Gradually
      I fell to dreaming, but recollected my mythology and sauntered towards the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At home, I learned that my grandmother had arranged to take Baburin; he
      had been assigned a small room in the servants&rsquo; quarters, overlooking the
      stable-yard. He had at once settled in there with his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had drunk my tea, next morning, without asking leave of
      Mademoiselle Friquet, I set off to the servants&rsquo; quarters. I wanted to
      have another chat with the queer fellow I had seen the day before. Without
      knocking at the door&mdash;the very idea of doing so would never have
      occurred to us&mdash;I walked straight into the room. I found in it not
      the man I was looking for, not Punin, but his protector&mdash;the
      philanthropist, Baburin. He was standing before the window, without his
      outer garment, his legs wide apart. He was busily engaged in rubbing his
      head and neck with a long towel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; he observed, keeping his hands still raised, and
      knitting his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Punin&rsquo;s not at home, then?&rsquo; I queried in the most free-and-easy manner,
      without taking off my cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Punin, Nikander Vavilitch, at this moment, is not at home, truly,&rsquo; 
      Baburin responded deliberately; &lsquo;but allow me to make an observation,
      young man: it&rsquo;s not the proper thing to come into another person&rsquo;s room
      like this, without asking leave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I! ... young man! ... how dared he! ... I grew crimson with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You cannot be aware who I am,&rsquo; I rejoined, in a manner no longer
      free-and-easy, but haughty. &lsquo;I am the grandson of the mistress here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all the same to me,&rsquo; retorted Baburin, setting to work with his
      towel again. &lsquo;Though you are the seignorial grandson, you have no right to
      come into other people&rsquo;s rooms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Other people&rsquo;s? What do you mean? I&rsquo;m&mdash;at home here&mdash;everywhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, excuse me: here&mdash;I&rsquo;m at home; since this room has been assigned
      to me, by agreement, in exchange for my work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t teach me, if you please,&rsquo; I interrupted: &lsquo;I know better than you
      what ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must be taught,&rsquo; he interrupted in his turn, &lsquo;for you&rsquo;re at an age
      when you ... I know my duties, but I know my rights too very well, and if
      you continue to speak to me in that way, I shall have to ask you to go out
      of the room....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no knowing how our dispute would have ended if Punin had not at
      that instant entered, shuffling and shambling from side to side. He most
      likely guessed from the expression of our faces that some unpleasantness
      had passed between us, and at once turned to me with the warmest
      expressions of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! little master! little master!&rsquo; he cried, waving his hands wildly, and
      going off into his noiseless laugh: &lsquo;the little dear! come to pay me a
      visit! here he&rsquo;s come, the little dear!&rsquo; (What&rsquo;s the meaning of it? I
      thought: can he be speaking in this familiar way to me?) &lsquo;There, come
      along, come with me into the garden. I&rsquo;ve found something there.... Why
      stay in this stuffiness here! let&rsquo;s go!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed Punin, but in the doorway I thought it as well to turn round
      and fling a glance of defiance at Baburin, as though to say, I&rsquo;m not
      afraid of you!
    </p>
    <p>
      He responded in the same way, and positively snorted into the towel&mdash;probably
      to make me thoroughly aware how utterly he despised me!
    </p>
    <p>
      What an insolent fellow your friend is!&rsquo; I said to Punin, directly the
      door had closed behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost with horror, Punin turned his plump face to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To whom did you apply that expression?&rsquo; he asked me, with round eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, to him, of course.... What&rsquo;s his name? that ... Baburin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Paramon Semyonevitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, yes; that ... blackfaced fellow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh ... eh ... eh ...!&rsquo; Punin protested, with caressing reproachfulness.
      &lsquo;How can you talk like that, little master! Paramon Semyonevitch is the
      most estimable man, of the strictest principles, an extraordinary person!
      To be sure, he won&rsquo;t allow any disrespect to him, because&mdash;he knows
      his own value. That man possesses a vast amount of knowledge&mdash;and
      it&rsquo;s not a place like this he ought to be filling! You must, my dear,
      behave very courteously to him; do you know, he&rsquo;s ...&rsquo; here Punin bent
      down quite to my ear,&mdash;&lsquo;a republican!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I stared at Punin. This I had not at all expected. From Keidanov&rsquo;s manual
      and other historical works I had gathered the fact that at some period or
      other, in ancient times, there had existed republicans, Greeks and Romans.
      For some unknown reason I had always pictured them all in helmets, with
      round shields on their arms, and big bare legs; but that in real life, in
      the actual present, above all, in Russia, in the province of X&mdash;&mdash;,
      one could come across republicans&mdash;that upset all my notions, and
      utterly confounded them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my dear, yes; Paramon Semyonitch is a republican,&rsquo; repeated Punin;
      &lsquo;there, so you&rsquo;ll know for the future how one should speak of a man like
      that! But now let&rsquo;s go into the garden. Fancy what I&rsquo;ve found there! A
      cuckoo&rsquo;s egg in a redstart&rsquo;s nest! a lovely thing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I went into the garden with Punin; but mentally I kept repeating:
      &lsquo;republican! re ... pub ... lican!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So,&rsquo; I decided at last&mdash;&lsquo;that&rsquo;s why he has such a blue chin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      My attitude to these two persons&mdash;Punin and Baburin&mdash;took
      definite shape from that very day. Baburin aroused in me a feeling of
      hostility with which there was, however, in a short time, mingled
      something akin to respect. And wasn&rsquo;t I afraid of him! I never got over
      being afraid of him even when the sharp severity of his manner with me at
      first had quite disappeared. It is needless to say that of Punin I had no
      fear; I did not even respect him; I looked upon him&mdash;not to put too
      fine a point on it&mdash;as a buffoon; but I loved him with my whole soul!
      To spend hours at a time in his company, to be alone with him, to listen
      to his stories, became a genuine delight to me. My grandmother was
      anything but pleased at this <i>intimité</i> with a person of the &lsquo;lower
      classes&rsquo;&mdash;<i>du commun</i>; but, whenever I could break away, I flew
      at once to my queer, amusing, beloved friend. Our meetings became more
      frequent after the departure of Mademoiselle Friquet, whom my grandmother
      sent back to Moscow in disgrace because, in conversation with a military
      staff captain, visiting in the neighbourhood, she had had the insolence to
      complain of the dulness which reigned in our household. And Punin, for his
      part, was not bored by long conversations with a boy of twelve; he seemed
      to seek them of himself. How often have I listened to his stories, sitting
      with him in the fragrant shade, on the dry, smooth grass, under the canopy
      of the silver poplars, or among the reeds above the pond, on the coarse,
      damp sand of the hollow bank, from which the knotted roots protruded,
      queerly interlaced, like great black veins, like snakes, like creatures
      emerging from some subterranean region! Punin told me the whole story of
      his life in minute detail, describing all his happy adventures, and all
      his misfortunes, with which I always felt the sincerest sympathy! His
      father had been a deacon;&mdash;&lsquo;a splendid man&mdash;but, under the
      influence of drink, stern to the last extreme.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin himself had received his education in a seminary; but, unable to
      stand the severe thrashings, and feeling no inclination for the priestly
      calling, he had become a layman, and in consequence had experienced all
      sorts of hardships; and, finally, had become a vagrant. &lsquo;And had I not met
      with my benefactor, Paramon Semyonitch,&rsquo; Punin commonly added (he never
      spoke of Baburin except in this way), &lsquo;I should have sunk into the miry
      abysses of poverty and vice.&rsquo; Punin was fond of high-sounding expressions,
      and had a great propensity, if not for lying, for romancing and
      exaggeration; he admired everything, fell into ecstasies over
      everything.... And I, in imitation of him, began to exaggerate and be
      ecstatic, too. &lsquo;What a crazy fellow you&rsquo;ve grown! God have mercy on you!&rsquo; 
      my old nurse used to say to me. Punin&rsquo;s narratives used to interest me
      extremely; but even better than his stories I loved the readings we used
      to have together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe the feeling I experienced when, snatching a
      favourable moment, suddenly, like a hermit in a tale or a good fairy, he
      appeared before me with a ponderous volume under his arm, and stealthily
      beckoning with his long crooked finger, and winking mysteriously, he
      pointed with his head, his eyebrows, his shoulders, his whole person,
      toward the deepest recesses of the garden, whither no one could penetrate
      after us, and where it was impossible to find us out. And when we had
      succeeded in getting away unnoticed; when we had satisfactorily reached
      one of our secret nooks, and were sitting side by side, and, at last, the
      book was slowly opened, emitting a pungent odour, inexpressibly sweet to
      me then, of mildew and age;&mdash;with what a thrill, with what a wave of
      dumb expectancy, I gazed at the face, at the lips of Punin, those lips
      from which in a moment a stream of such delicious eloquence was to flow!
      At last the first sounds of the reading were heard. Everything around me
      vanished ... no, not vanished, but grew far away, passed into clouds of
      mist, leaving behind only an impression of something friendly and
      protecting. Those trees, those green leaves, those high grasses screen us,
      hide us from all the rest of the world; no one knows where we are, what we
      are about&mdash;while with us is poetry, we are saturated in it,
      intoxicated with it, something solemn, grand, mysterious is happening to
      us.... Punin, by preference, kept to poetry, musical, sonorous poetry; he
      was ready to lay down his life for poetry. He did not read, he declaimed
      the verse majestically, in a torrent of rhythm, in a rolling outpour
      through his nose, like a man intoxicated, lifted out of himself, like the
      Pythian priestess. And another habit he had: first he would lisp the
      verses through softly, in a whisper, as it were mumbling them to
      himself.... This he used to call the rough sketch of the reading; then he
      would thunder out the same verse in its &lsquo;fair copy,&rsquo; and would all at once
      leap up, throw up his hand, with a half-supplicating, half-imperious
      gesture.... In this way we went through not only Lomonosov, Sumarokov, and
      Kantemir (the older the poems, the more they were to Punin&rsquo;s taste), but
      even Heraskov&rsquo;s <i>Rossiad</i>. And, to tell the truth, it was this same
      <i>Rossiad</i> which aroused my enthusiasm most. There is in it, among
      others, a mighty Tatar woman, a gigantic heroine; I have forgotten even
      her name now; but in those days my hands and feet turned cold as soon as
      it was mentioned. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Punin would say, nodding his head with great
      significance, &lsquo;Heraskov, he doesn&rsquo;t let one off easily. At times one comes
      upon a line, simply heart-breaking.... One can only stick to it, and do
      one&rsquo;s best.... One tries to master it, but he breaks away again and
      trumpets, trumpets, with the crash of cymbals. His name&rsquo;s been well
      bestowed on him&mdash;the very word, Herrraskov!&rsquo; Lomonosov Punin found
      fault with for too simple and free a style; while to Derzhavin he
      maintained an attitude almost of hostility, saying that he was more of a
      courtier than a poet. In our house it was not merely that no attention was
      given to literature, to poetry; but poetry, especially Russian poetry, was
      looked upon as something quite undignified and vulgar; my grandmother did
      not even call it poetry, but &lsquo;doggrel verses&rsquo;; every author of such
      doggrel was, in her opinion, either a confirmed toper or a perfect idiot.
      Brought up among such ideas, it was inevitable that I should either turn
      from Punin with disgust&mdash;he was untidy and shabby into the bargain,
      which was an offence to my seignorial habits&mdash;or that, attracted and
      captivated by him, I should follow his example, and be infected by his
      passion for poetry.... And so it turned out. I, too, began reading poetry,
      or, as my grandmother expressed it, poring over doggrel trash.... I even
      tried my hand at versifying, and composed a poem, descriptive of a
      barrel-organ, in which occurred the following two lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Lo, the barrel turns around,
  And the cogs within resound.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Punin commended in this effort a certain imitative melody, but disapproved
      of the subject itself as low and unworthy of lyrical treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! all those efforts and emotions and transports, our solitary
      readings, our life together, our poetry, all came to an end at once.
      Trouble broke upon us suddenly, like a clap of thunder.

      My grandmother in everything liked cleanliness and order, quite in the
      spirit of the active generals of those days; cleanliness and order were to
      be maintained too in our garden. And so from time to time they &lsquo;drove&rsquo; 
      into it poor peasants, who had no families, no land, no beasts of their
      own, and those among the house serfs who were out of favour or
      superannuated, and set them to clearing the paths, weeding the borders,
      breaking up and sifting the earth in the beds, and so on. Well, one day,
      in the very heat of these operations, my grandmother went into the garden,
      and took me with her. On all sides, among the trees and about the lawns,
      we caught glimpses of white, red, and blue smocks; on all sides we heard
      the scraping and clanging of spades, the dull thud of clods of earth on
      the slanting sieves. As she passed by the labourers, my grandmother with
      her eagle eye noticed at once that one of them was working with less
      energy than the rest, and that he took off his cap, too, with no show of
      eagerness. This was a youth, still quite young, with a wasted face, and
      sunken, lustreless eyes. His cotton smock, all torn and patched, scarcely
      held together over his narrow shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; my grandmother inquired of Filippitch, who was walking on
      tiptoe behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of whom ... you are pleased ...&rsquo; Filippitch stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, fool! I mean the one that looked so sullenly at me. There, standing
      yonder, not working.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, him! Yes ... th ... th ... that&rsquo;s Yermil, son of Pavel Afanasiitch,
      now deceased.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pavel Afanasiitch had been, ten years before, head butler in my
      grandmother&rsquo;s house, and stood particularly high in her favour. But
      suddenly falling into disgrace, he was as suddenly degraded to being
      herdsman, and did not long keep even that position. He sank lower still,
      and struggled on for a while on a monthly pittance of flour in a little
      hut far away. At last he had died of paralysis, leaving his family in the
      most utter destitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; commented my grandmother; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s clear the apple&rsquo;s not fallen far
      from the tree. Well, we shall have to make arrangements about this fellow
      too. I&rsquo;ve no need of people like that, with scowling faces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother went back to the house&mdash;and made arrangements. Three
      hours later Yermil, completely &lsquo;equipped,&rsquo; was brought under the window of
      her room. The unfortunate boy was being transported to a settlement; the
      other side of the fence, a few steps from him, was a little cart loaded
      with his poor belongings. Such were the times then. Yermil stood without
      his cap, with downcast head, barefoot, with his boots tied up with a
      string behind his back; his face, turned towards the seignorial mansion,
      expressed not despair nor grief, nor even bewilderment; a stupid smile was
      frozen on his colourless lips; his eyes, dry and half-closed, looked
      stubbornly on the ground. My grandmother was apprised of his presence. She
      got up from the sofa, went, with a faint rustle of her silken skirts, to
      the window of the study, and, holding her golden-rimmed double eyeglass on
      the bridge of her nose, looked at the new exile. In her room there
      happened to be at the moment four other persons, the butler, Baburin, the
      page who waited on my grandmother in the daytime, and I.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother nodded her head up and down....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; a hoarse almost stifled voice was heard suddenly. I looked round.
      Baburin&rsquo;s face was red ... dark red; under his overhanging brows could be
      seen little sharp points of light.... There was no doubt about it; it was
      he, it was Baburin, who had uttered the word &lsquo;Madam.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother too looked round, and turned her eyeglass from Yermil to
      Baburin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is that ... speaking?&rsquo; she articulated slowly ... through her nose.
      Baburin moved slightly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;it is I.... I venture ... I imagine ... I make bold to
      submit to your honour that you are making a mistake in acting as ... as
      you are pleased to act at this moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is?&rsquo; my grandmother said, in the same voice, not removing her
      eyeglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take the liberty ...&rsquo; Baburin went on distinctly, uttering every word
      though with obvious effort&mdash;&lsquo;I am referring to the case of this lad
      who is being sent away to a settlement ... for no fault of his. Such
      arrangements, I venture to submit, lead to dissatisfaction, and to other&mdash;which
      God forbid!&mdash;consequences, and are nothing else than a transgression
      of the powers allowed to seignorial proprietors.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where have you studied, pray?&rsquo; my grandmother asked after a short
      silence, and she dropped her eyeglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baburin was disconcerted. &lsquo;What are you pleased to wish?&rsquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask you: where have you studied? You use such learned words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ... my education ...&rsquo; Baburin was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother shrugged her shoulders contemptuously. &lsquo;It seems,&rsquo; she
      interrupted, &lsquo;that my arrangements are not to your liking. That is of
      absolutely no consequence to me&mdash;among my subjects I am sovereign,
      and answerable to no one for them, only I am not accustomed to having
      people criticising me in my presence, and meddling in what is not their
      business. I have no need of learned philanthropists of nondescript
      position; I want servants to do my will without question. So I always
      lived till you came, and so I shall live after you&rsquo;ve gone. You do not
      suit me; you are discharged. Nikolai Antonov,&rsquo; my grandmother turned to
      the steward, &lsquo;pay this man off; and let him be gone before dinner-time
      to-day! D&rsquo;you hear? Don&rsquo;t put me into a passion. And the other too ... the
      fool that lives with him&mdash;to be sent off too. What&rsquo;s Yermilka waiting
      for?&rsquo; she added, looking out of window, &lsquo;I have seen him. What more does
      he want?&rsquo; My grandmother shook her handkerchief in the direction of the
      window, as though to drive away an importunate fly. Then she sat down in a
      low chair, and turning towards us, gave the order grimly: &lsquo;Everybody
      present to leave the room!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We all withdrew&mdash;all, except the day page, to whom my grandmother&rsquo;s
      words did not apply, because he was nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother&rsquo;s decree was carried out to the letter. Before dinner, both
      Baburin and my friend Punin were driving away from the place. I will not
      undertake to describe my grief, my genuine, truly childish despair. It was
      so strong that it stifled even the feeling of awe-stricken admiration
      inspired by the bold action of the republican Baburin. After the
      conversation with my grandmother, he went at once to his room and began
      packing up. He did not vouchsafe me one word, one look, though I was the
      whole time hanging about him, or rather, in reality, about Punin. The
      latter was utterly distraught, and he too said nothing; but he was
      continually glancing at me, and tears stood in his eyes ... always the
      same tears; they neither fell nor dried up. He did not venture to
      criticise his &lsquo;benefactor&rsquo;&mdash;Paramon Semyonitch could not make a
      mistake,&mdash;but great was his distress and dejection. Punin and I made
      an effort to read something out of the <i>Rossiad</i> for the last time;
      we even locked ourselves up in the lumber-room&mdash;it was useless to
      dream of going into the garden&mdash;but at the very first line we both
      broke down, and I fairly bellowed like a calf, in spite of my twelve
      years, and my claims to be grown-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had taken his seat in the carriage Baburin at last turned to me,
      and with a slight softening of the accustomed sternness of his face,
      observed: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a lesson for you, young gentleman; remember this incident,
      and when you grow up, try to put an end to such acts of injustice. Your
      heart is good, your nature is not yet corrupted.... Mind, be careful;
      things can&rsquo;t go on like this!&rsquo; Through my tears, which streamed copiously
      over my nose, my lips, and my chin, I faltered out that I would ... I
      would remember, that I promised ... I would do ... I would be sure ...
      quite sure ...
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this point, Punin, whom I had before this embraced twenty times (my
      cheeks were burning from the contact with his unshaven beard, and I was
      odoriferous of the smell that always clung to him)&mdash;at this point a
      sudden frenzy came over Punin. He jumped up on the seat of the cart, flung
      both hands up in the air, and began in a voice of thunder (where he got it
      from!) to declaim the well-known paraphrase of the Psalm of David by
      Derzhavin,&mdash;a poet for this occasion&mdash;not a courtier.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;God the All-powerful doth arise
  And judgeth in the congregation of the mighty! ...
  How long, how long, saith the Lord,
  Will ye have mercy on the wicked?
  &ldquo;Ye have to keep the laws....&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down!&rsquo; Baburin said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin sat down, but continued:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;To save the guiltless and needy,
  To give shelter to the afflicted,
  To defend the weak from the oppressors.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Punin at the word &lsquo;oppressors&rsquo; pointed to the seignorial abode, and then
      poked the driver in the back.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;To deliver the poor out of bondage!
  They know not! neither will they understand! ...&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Nikolai Antonov running out of the seignorial abode, shouted at the top of
      his voice to the coachman: &lsquo;Get away with you! owl! go along! don&rsquo;t stay
      lingering here!&rsquo; and the cart rolled away. Only in the distance could
      still be heard:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Arise, O Lord God of righteousness! ...
  Come forth to judge the unjust&mdash;
  And be Thou the only Ruler of the nations!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a clown!&rsquo; remarked Nikolai Antonov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t get enough of the rod in his young days,&rsquo; observed the deacon,
      appearing on the steps. He had come to inquire what hour it would please
      the mistress to fix for the night service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day, learning that Yermil was still in the village, and would not
      till early next morning be despatched to the town for the execution of
      certain legal formalities, which were intended to check the arbitrary
      proceedings of the landowners, but served only as a source of additional
      revenue to the functionaries in superintendence of them, I sought him out,
      and, for lack of money of my own, handed him a bundle, in which I had tied
      up two pocket-handkerchiefs, a shabby pair of slippers, a comb, an old
      night-gown, and a perfectly new silk cravat. Yermil, whom I had to wake up&mdash;he
      was lying on a heap of straw in the back yard, near the cart&mdash;Yermil
      took my present rather indifferently, with some hesitation in fact, did
      not thank me, promptly poked his head into the straw and fell asleep
      again. I went home somewhat disappointed. I had imagined that he would be
      astonished and overjoyed at my visit, would see in it a pledge of my
      magnanimous intentions for the future&mdash;and instead of that ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may say what you like&mdash;these people have no feeling,&rsquo; was my
      reflection on my homeward way.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandmother, who had for some reason left me in peace the whole of that
      memorable day, looked at me suspiciously when I came after supper to say
      good-night to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your eyes are red,&rsquo; she observed to me in French; &lsquo;and there&rsquo;s a smell of
      the peasant&rsquo;s hut about you. I am not going to enter into an examination
      of what you&rsquo;ve been feeling and doing&mdash;I should not like to be
      obliged to punish you&mdash;but I hope you will get over all your
      foolishness, and begin to conduct yourself once more in a manner befitting
      a well-bred boy. However, we are soon going back to Moscow, and I shall
      get you a tutor&mdash;as I see you need a man&rsquo;s hand to manage you. You
      can go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We did, as a fact, go back soon after to Moscow.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1837
    </h3>
    <p>
      Seven years had passed by. We were living as before at Moscow&mdash;but I
      was by now a student in my second year&mdash;and the authority of my
      grandmother, who had aged very perceptibly in the last years, no longer
      weighed upon me. Of all my fellow-students the one with whom I was on the
      friendliest terms was a light-hearted and good-natured youth called
      Tarhov. Our habits and our tastes were similar. Tarhov was a great lover
      of poetry, and himself wrote verses; while in me the seeds sown by Punin
      had not been without fruit. As is often the case with young people who are
      very close friends, we had no secrets from one another. But behold, for
      several days together I noticed a certain excitement and agitation in
      Tarhov.... He disappeared for hours at a time, and I did not know where he
      had got to&mdash;a thing which had never happened before. I was on the
      point of demanding, in the name of friendship, a full explanation.... He
      anticipated me.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I was sitting in his room.... &lsquo;Petya,&rsquo; he said suddenly, blushing
      gaily, and looking me straight in the face, &lsquo;I must introduce you to my
      muse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your muse! how queerly you talk! Like a classicist. (Romanticism was at
      that time, in 1837, at its full height.) As if I had not known it ever so
      long&mdash;your muse! Have you written a new poem, or what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t understand what I mean,&rsquo; rejoined Tarhov, still laughing and
      blushing. &lsquo;I will introduce you to a living muse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha! so that&rsquo;s it! But how is she&mdash;yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, because ... But hush, I believe it&rsquo;s she coming here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the light click of hurrying heels, the door opened, and in the
      doorway appeared a girl of eighteen, in a chintz cotton gown, with a black
      cloth cape on her shoulders, and a black straw hat on her fair, rather
      curly hair. On seeing me she was frightened and disconcerted, and was
      beating a retreat ... but Tarhov at once rushed to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please, please, Musa Pavlovna, come in! This is my great friend, a
      splendid fellow&mdash;and the soul of discretion. You&rsquo;ve no need to be
      afraid of him. Petya,&rsquo; he turned to me, &lsquo;let me introduce my Musa&mdash;Musa
      Pavlovna Vinogradov, a great friend of mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is that ... Musa?&rsquo; I was beginning.... Tarhov laughed. &lsquo;Ah, you
      didn&rsquo;t know there was such a name in the calendar? I didn&rsquo;t know it
      either, my boy, till I met this dear young lady. Musa! such a charming
      name! And suits her so well!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I bowed again to my comrade&rsquo;s great friend. She left the door, took two
      steps forward and stood still. She was very attractive, but I could not
      agree with Tarhov&rsquo;s opinion, and inwardly said to myself: &lsquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a
      strange sort of muse!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The features of her curved, rosy face were small and delicate; there was
      an air of fresh, buoyant youth about all her slender, miniature figure;
      but of the muse, of the personification of the muse, I&mdash;and not only
      I&mdash;all the young people of that time had a very different conception!
      First of all the muse had infallibly to be dark-haired and pale. An
      expression of scornful pride, a bitter smile, a glance of inspiration, and
      that &lsquo;something&rsquo;&mdash;mysterious, demonic, fateful&mdash;that was
      essential to our conception of the muse, the muse of Byron, who at that
      time held sovereign sway over men&rsquo;s fancies. There was nothing of that
      kind to be discerned in the face of the girl who came in. Had I been a
      little older and more experienced I should probably have paid more
      attention to her eyes, which were small and deep-set, with full lids, but
      dark as agate, alert and bright, a thing rare in fair-haired people.
      Poetical tendencies I should not have detected in their rapid, as it were
      elusive, glance, but hints of a passionate soul, passionate to
      self-forgetfulness. But I was very young then.
    </p>
    <p>
      I held out my hand to Musa Pavlovna&mdash;she did not give me hers&mdash;she
      did not notice my movement; she sat down on the chair Tarhov placed for
      her, but did not take off her hat and cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was, obviously, ill at ease; my presence embarrassed her. She drew
      deep breaths, at irregular intervals, as though she were gasping for air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve only come to you for one minute, Vladimir Nikolaitch,&rsquo; she began&mdash;her
      voice was very soft and deep; from her crimson, almost childish lips, it
      seemed rather strange;&mdash;&lsquo;but our madame would not let me out for more
      than half an hour. You weren&rsquo;t well the day before yesterday ... and so, I
      thought ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stammered and hung her head. Under the shade of her thick, low brows
      her dark eyes darted&mdash;to and fro&mdash;elusively. There are dark,
      swift, flashing beetles that flit so in the heat of summer among the
      blades of dry grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How good you are, Musa, Musotchka!&rsquo; cried Tarhov. &lsquo;But you must stay, you
      must stay a little.... We&rsquo;ll have the samovar in directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no, Vladimir Nikolaevitch! it&rsquo;s impossible! I must go away this
      minute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must rest a little, anyway. You&rsquo;re out of breath.... You&rsquo;re tired.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not tired. It&rsquo;s ... not that ... only ... give me another book; I&rsquo;ve
      finished this one.&rsquo; She took out of her pocket a tattered grey volume of a
      Moscow edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, of course. Well, did you like it? <i>Roslavlev</i>,&rsquo; added
      Tarhov, addressing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Only I think <i>Yury Miloslavsky</i> is much better. Our madame is
      very strict about books. She says they hinder our working. For, to her
      thinking ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, I say, <i>Yury Miloslavsky</i>&rsquo;s not equal to Pushkin&rsquo;s <i>Gipsies</i>?
      Eh? Musa Pavlovna?&rsquo; Tarhov broke in with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed! The <i>Gipsies</i> ...&rsquo; she murmured slowly. &lsquo;Oh yes, another
      thing, Vladimir Nikolaitch; don&rsquo;t come to-morrow ... you know where.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s impossible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl shrugged her shoulders, and all at once, as though she had
      received a sudden shove, got up from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Musa, Musotchka,&rsquo; Tarhov expostulated plaintively. &lsquo;Stay a little!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo; She went quickly to the door, took hold of the
      handle....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, at least, take the book!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarhov rushed towards the girl, but at that instant she darted out of the
      room. He almost knocked his nose against the door. &lsquo;What a girl! She&rsquo;s a
      regular little viper!&rsquo; he declared with some vexation, and then sank into
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stayed at Tarhov&rsquo;s. I wanted to find out what was the meaning of it all.
      Tarhov was not disposed to be reserved. He told me that the girl was a
      milliner; that he had seen her for the first time three weeks before in a
      fashionable shop, where he had gone on a commission for his sister, who
      lived in the provinces, to buy a hat; that he had fallen in love with her
      at first sight, and that next day he had succeeded in speaking to her in
      the street; that she had herself, it seemed, taken rather a fancy to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only, please, don&rsquo;t you suppose,&rsquo; he added with warmth,&mdash;&lsquo;don&rsquo;t you
      imagine any harm of her. So far, at any rate, there&rsquo;s been nothing of that
      sort between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harm!&rsquo; I caught him up; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt of that; and I&rsquo;ve no doubt either
      that you sincerely deplore the fact, my dear fellow! Have patience&mdash;everything
      will come right&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; Tarhov muttered through his teeth, though with a laugh. &lsquo;But
      really, my boy, that girl ... I tell you&mdash;it&rsquo;s a new type, you know.
      You hadn&rsquo;t time to get a good look at her. She&rsquo;s a shy thing!&mdash;oo!
      such a shy thing! and what a will of her own! But that very shyness is
      what I like in her. It&rsquo;s a sign of independence! I&rsquo;m simply over head and
      ears, my boy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarhov fell to talking of his &lsquo;charmer,&rsquo; and even read me the beginning of
      a poem entitled: &lsquo;My Muse.&rsquo; His emotional outpourings were not quite to my
      taste. I felt secretly jealous of him. I soon left him.

    <p>
      A few days after I happened to be passing through one of the arcades of
      the Gostinny Dvor. It was Saturday; there were crowds of people shopping;
      on all sides, in the midst of the pushing and crushing, the shopmen kept
      shouting to people to buy. Having bought what I wanted, I was thinking of
      nothing but getting away from their teasing importunity as soon as
      possible&mdash;when all at once I halted involuntarily: in a fruit shop I
      caught sight of my comrade&rsquo;s charmer&mdash;Musa, Musa Pavlovna! She was
      standing, profile to me, and seemed to be waiting for something. After a
      moment&rsquo;s hesitation I made up my mind to go up to her and speak. But I had
      hardly passed through the doorway of the shop and taken off my cap, when
      she tottered back dismayed, turned quickly to an old man in a frieze
      cloak, for whom the shopman was weighing out a pound of raisins, and
      clutched at his arm, as though fleeing to put herself under his
      protection. The latter, in his turn, wheeled round facing her&mdash;and,
      imagine my amazement, I recognised him as Punin!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was he; there were his inflamed eyes, his full lips, his soft,
      overhanging nose. He had, in fact, changed little during the last seven
      years; his face was a little flabbier, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nikander Vavilitch!&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rsquo; Punin started, opened
      his mouth, stared at me....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t the honour,&rsquo; he was beginning&mdash;and all at once he piped
      out shrilly: &lsquo;The little master of Troïtsky (my grandmother&rsquo;s property was
      called Troïtsky)! Can it be the little master of Troïtsky?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The pound of raisins tumbled out of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It really is,&rsquo; I answered, and, picking up Punin&rsquo;s purchase from the
      ground, I kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was breathless with delight and excitement; he almost cried, removed
      his cap&mdash;which enabled me to satisfy myself that the last traces of
      hair had vanished from his &lsquo;egg&rsquo;&mdash;took a handkerchief out of it, blew
      his nose, poked the cap into his bosom with the raisins, put it on again,
      again dropped the raisins.... I don&rsquo;t know how Musa was behaving all this
      time, I tried not to look at her. I don&rsquo;t imagine Punin&rsquo;s agitation
      proceeded from any extreme attachment to my person; it was simply that his
      nature could not stand the slightest unexpected shock. The nervous
      excitability of these poor devils!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come and see us, my dear boy,&rsquo; he faltered at last; &lsquo;you won&rsquo;t be too
      proud to visit our humble nest? You&rsquo;re a student, I see ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, I shall be delighted, really.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you independent now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly independent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s capital! How pleased Paramon Semyonitch will be! To-day he&rsquo;ll be
      home earlier than usual, and madame lets her, too, off for Saturdays. But,
      stop, excuse me, I am quite forgetting myself. Of course, you don&rsquo;t know
      our niece!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I hastened to slip in that I had not yet had the pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, of course! How could you know her! Musotchka ... Take note, my
      dear sir, this girl&rsquo;s name is Musa&mdash;and it&rsquo;s not a nickname, but her
      real name ... Isn&rsquo;t that a predestination? Musotchka, I want to introduce
      you to Mr. ... Mr. ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;B.,&rsquo; I prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;B.,&rsquo; he repeated. &lsquo;Musotchka, listen! You see before you the most
      excellent, most delightful of young men. Fate threw us together when he
      was still in years of boyhood! I beg you to look on him as a friend!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I swung off a low bow. Musa, red as a poppy, flashed a look on me from
      under her eyelids, and dropped them immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; thought I, &lsquo;you &lsquo;re one of those who in difficult moments don&rsquo;t turn
      pale, but red; that must be made a note of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must be indulgent, she&rsquo;s not a fine lady,&rsquo; observed Punin, and he
      went out of the shop into the street; Musa and I followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The house in which Punin lodged was a considerable distance from the
      Gostinny Dvor, being, in fact, in Sadovoy Street. On the way my former
      preceptor in poetry had time to communicate a good many details of his
      mode of existence. Since the time of our parting, both he and Baburin had
      been tossed about holy Russia pretty thoroughly, and had not long&mdash;only
      a year and a half before&mdash;found a permanent home in Moscow. Baburin
      had succeeded in becoming head-clerk in the office of a rich merchant and
      manufacturer. &lsquo;Not a lucrative berth,&rsquo; Punin observed with a sigh,&mdash;&lsquo;a
      lot of work, and not much profit ... but what&rsquo;s one to do? One must be
      thankful to get that! I, too, am trying to earn something by copying and
      lessons; only my efforts have so far not been crowned with success. My
      writing, you perhaps recollect, is old-fashioned, not in accordance with
      the tastes of the day; and as regards lessons&mdash;what has been a great
      obstacle is the absence of befitting attire; moreover, I greatly fear that
      in the matter of instruction&mdash;in the subject of Russian literature&mdash;I
      am also not in harmony with the tastes of the day; and so it comes about
      that I am turned away.&rsquo; (Punin laughed his sleepy, subdued laugh. He had
      retained his old, somewhat high-flown manner of speech, and his old
      weakness for falling into rhyme.) &lsquo;All run after novelties, nothing but
      innovations! I dare say you, too, do not honour the old divinities, and
      fall down before new idols?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you, Nikander Vavilitch, do you really still esteem Heraskov?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin stood still and waved both hands at once. &lsquo;In the highest degree,
      sir! in the high ... est de ... gree, I do!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you don&rsquo;t read Pushkin? You don&rsquo;t like Pushkin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin again flung his hands up higher than his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pushkin? Pushkin is the snake, lying hid in the grass, who is endowed
      with the note of the nightingale!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While Punin and I talked like this, cautiously picking our way over the
      unevenly laid brick pavement of so-called &lsquo;white-stoned&rsquo; Moscow&mdash;in
      which there is not one stone, and which is not white at all&mdash;Musa
      walked silently beside us on the side further from me. In speaking of her,
      I called her &lsquo;your niece.&rsquo; Punin was silent for a little, scratched his
      head, and informed me in an undertone that he had called her so ... merely
      as a manner of speaking; that she was really no relation; that she was an
      orphan picked up and cared for by Baburin in the town of Voronezh; but
      that he, Punin, might well call her daughter, as he loved her no less than
      a real daughter. I had no doubt that, though Punin intentionally dropped
      his voice, Musa could hear all he said very well; and she was at once
      angry, and shy, and embarrassed; and the lights and shades chased each
      other over her face, and everything in it was slightly quivering, the
      eyelids and brows and lips and narrow nostrils. All this was very
      charming, and amusing, and queer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last we reached the &lsquo;modest nest.&rsquo; And modest it certainly was, the
      nest. It consisted of a small, one-storied house, that seemed almost sunk
      into the ground, with a slanting wooden roof, and four dingy windows in
      the front. The furniture of the rooms was of the poorest, and not over
      tidy, indeed. Between the windows and on the walls hung about a dozen tiny
      wooden cages containing larks, canaries, and siskins. &lsquo;My subjects!&rsquo; Punin
      pronounced triumphantly, pointing his finger at them. We had hardly time
      to get in and look about us, Punin had hardly sent Musa for the samovar,
      when Baburin himself came in. He seemed to me to have aged much more than
      Punin, though his step was as firm as ever, and the expression of his face
      altogether was unchanged; but he had grown thin and bent, his cheeks were
      sunken, and his thick black shock of hair was sprinkled with grey. He did
      not recognise me, and showed no particular pleasure when Punin mentioned
      my name; he did not even smile with his eyes, he barely nodded; he asked&mdash;very
      carelessly and drily&mdash;whether my <i>granny</i> were living&mdash;and
      that was all. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not over-delighted at a visit from a nobleman,&rsquo; he
      seemed to say; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel flattered by it.&rsquo; The republican was a
      republican still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musa came back; a decrepit little old woman followed her, bringing in a
      tarnished samovar. Punin began fussing about, and pressing me to take
      things; Baburin sat down to the table, leaned his head on his hands, and
      looked with weary eyes about him. At tea, however, he began to talk. He
      was dissatisfied with his position. &lsquo;A screw&mdash;not a man,&rsquo; so he spoke
      of his employer; &lsquo;people in a subordinate position are so much dirt to
      him, of no consequence whatever; and yet it&rsquo;s not so long since he was
      under the yoke himself. Nothing but cruelty and covetousness. It&rsquo;s a
      bondage worse than the government&rsquo;s! And all the trade here rests on
      swindling and flourishes on nothing else!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing such dispiriting utterances, Punin sighed expressively, assented,
      shook his head up and down, and from side to side; Musa maintained a
      stubborn silence.... She was obviously fretted by the doubt, what I was,
      whether I was a discreet person or a gossip. And if I were discreet,
      whether it was not with some afterthought in my mind. Her dark, swift,
      restless eyes fairly flashed to and fro under their half-drooping lids.
      Only once she glanced at me, but so inquisitively, so searchingly, almost
      viciously ... I positively started. Baburin scarcely talked to her at all;
      but whenever he did address her, there was a note of austere, hardly
      fatherly, tenderness in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin, on the contrary, was continually joking with Musa; she responded
      unwillingly, however. He called her little snow-maiden, little snowflake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you give Musa Pavlovna such names?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin laughed. &lsquo;Because she&rsquo;s such a chilly little thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sensible,&rsquo; put in Baburin: &lsquo;as befits a young girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We may call her the mistress of the house,&rsquo; cried Punin. &lsquo;Hey? Paramon
      Semyonitch?&rsquo; Baburin frowned; Musa turned away ... I did not understand
      the hint at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed two hours ... in no very lively fashion, though Punin did his
      best to &lsquo;entertain the honourable company.&rsquo; For instance, he squatted down
      in front of the cage of one of the canaries, opened the door, and
      commanded: &lsquo;On the cupola! Begin the concert!&rsquo; The canary fluttered out at
      once, perched on the <i>cupola</i>, that is to say, on Punin&rsquo;s bald pate,
      and turning from side to side, and shaking its little wings, carolled with
      all its might. During the whole time the concert lasted, Punin kept
      perfectly still, only conducting with his finger, and half closing his
      eyes. I could not help roaring with laughter ... but neither Baburin nor
      Musa laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I was leaving, Baburin surprised me by an unexpected question. He
      wished to ask me, as a man studying at the university, what sort of person
      Zeno was, and what were my ideas about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What Zeno?&rsquo; I asked, somewhat puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Zeno, the sage of antiquity. Surely he cannot be unknown to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I vaguely recalled the name of Zeno, as the founder of the school of
      Stoics; but I knew absolutely nothing more about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he was a philosopher,&rsquo; I pronounced, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Zeno,&rsquo; Baburin resumed in deliberate tones, &lsquo;was that wise man, who
      declared that suffering was not an evil, since fortitude overcomes all
      things, and that the good in this world is one: justice; and virtue itself
      is nothing else than justice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin turned a reverent ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man living here who has picked up a lot of old books, told me that
      saying,&rsquo; continued Baburin; &lsquo;it pleased me much. But I see you are not
      interested in such subjects.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Baburin was right. In such subjects I certainly was not interested. Since
      I had entered the university, I had become as much of a republican as
      Baburin himself. Of Mirabeau, of Robespierre, I would have talked with
      zest. Robespierre, indeed ... why, I had hanging over my writing-table the
      lithographed portraits of Fouquier-Tinville and Chalier! But Zeno! Why
      drag in Zeno?
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said good-bye to me, Punin insisted very warmly on my visiting them
      next day, Sunday; Baburin did not invite me at all, and even remarked
      between his teeth, that talking to plain people of nondescript position
      could not give me any great pleasure, and would most likely be
      disagreeable to my <i>granny</i>. At that word I interrupted him, however,
      and gave him to understand that my grandmother had no longer any authority
      over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve not come into possession of the property, have you?&rsquo; queried
      Baburin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, it follows ...&rsquo; Baburin did not finish his sentence; but I
      mentally finished it for him: &lsquo;it follows that I&rsquo;m a boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo; I said aloud, and I retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was just going out of the courtyard into the street ... Musa suddenly
      ran out of the house, and slipping a piece of crumpled paper into my hand,
      disappeared at once. At the first lamp-post I unfolded the paper. It
      turned out to be a note. With difficulty I deciphered the pale
      pencil-marks. &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; Musa had written, &lsquo;come to-morrow after
      matins to the Alexandrovsky garden near the Kutafia tower I shall wait for
      you don&rsquo;t refuse me don&rsquo;t make me miserable I simply must see you.&rsquo; There
      were no mistakes in spelling in this note, but neither was there any
      punctuation. I returned home in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When, a quarter of an hour before the appointed time, next day, I began to
      get near the Kutafia tower (it was early in April, the buds were swelling,
      the grass was growing greener, and the sparrows were noisily chirrupping
      and quarrelling in the bare lilac bushes), considerably to my surprise, I
      caught sight of Musa a little to one side, not far from the fence. She was
      there before me. I was going towards her; but she herself came to meet me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the Kreml wall,&rsquo; she whispered in a hurried voice, running
      her downcast eyes over the ground; &lsquo;there are people here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We went along the path up the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Musa Pavlovna,&rsquo; I was beginning.... But she cut me short at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please,&rsquo; she began, speaking in the same jerky and subdued voice, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
      criticise me, don&rsquo;t think any harm of me. I wrote a letter to you, I made
      an appointment to meet you, because ... I was afraid.... It seemed to me
      yesterday,&mdash;you seemed to be laughing all the time. Listen,&rsquo; she
      added, with sudden energy, and she stopped short and turned towards me:
      &lsquo;listen; if you tell with whom ... if you mention at whose room you met
      me, I&rsquo;ll throw myself in the water, I&rsquo;ll drown myself, I&rsquo;ll make an end of
      myself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, for the first time, she glanced at me with the inquisitive,
      piercing look I had seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, she, perhaps, really ... would do it,&rsquo; was my thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, Musa Pavlovna,&rsquo; I protested, hurriedly: &lsquo;how can you have such a
      bad opinion of me? Do you suppose I am capable of betraying my friend and
      injuring you? Besides, come to that, there&rsquo;s nothing in your relations, as
      far as I&rsquo;m aware, deserving of censure.... For goodness&rsquo; sake, be calm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Musa heard me out, without stirring from the spot, or looking at me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s something else I ought to tell you,&rsquo; she began, moving forward
      again along the path, &lsquo;or else you may think I&rsquo;m quite mad! I ought to
      tell you, that old man wants to marry me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What old man? The bald one? Punin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;not he! The other ... Paramon Semyonitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Baburin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it possible? Has he made you an offer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you didn&rsquo;t consent, of course?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I did consent ... because I didn&rsquo;t understand what I was about then.
      Now it&rsquo;s a different matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I flung up my hands. &lsquo;Baburin&mdash;and you! Why, he must be fifty!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He says forty-three. But that makes no difference. If he were five&mdash;and&mdash;twenty
      I wouldn&rsquo;t marry him. Much happiness I should find in it! A whole week
      will go by without his smiling once! Paramon Semyonitch is my benefactor,
      I am deeply indebted to him; he took care of me, educated me; I should
      have been utterly lost but for him; I&rsquo;m bound to look on him as a
      father.... But be his wife! I&rsquo;d rather die! I&rsquo;d rather be in my coffin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you keep talking about death, Musa Pavlovna?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Musa stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, is life so sweet, then? Even your friend Vladimir Nikolaitch, I may
      say, I&rsquo;ve come to love from being wretched and dull: and then Paramon
      Semyonitch with his offers of marriage.... Punin, though he bores me with
      his verses, he doesn&rsquo;t scare me, anyway; he doesn&rsquo;t make me read Karamzin
      in the evenings, when my head&rsquo;s ready to drop off my shoulders for
      weariness! And what are these old men to me? They call me cold, too. With
      them, is it likely I should be warm? If they try to make me&mdash;I shall
      go. Paramon Semyonitch himself&rsquo;s always saying: Freedom! freedom! All
      right, I want freedom too. Or else it comes to this! Freedom for every one
      else, and keeping me in a cage! I&rsquo;ll tell him so myself. But if you betray
      me, or drop a hint&mdash;remember; they&rsquo;ll never set eyes on me again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Musa stood in the middle of the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll never set eyes on me again!&rsquo; she repeated sharply. This time,
      too, she did not raise her eyes to me; she seemed to be aware that she
      would infallibly betray herself, would show what was in her heart, if any
      one looked her straight in the face.... And that was just why she did not
      lift her eyes, except when she was angry or annoyed, and then she stared
      straight at the person she was speaking to.... But her small pretty face
      was aglow with indomitable resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Tarhov was right,&rsquo; flashed through my head; &lsquo;this girl is a new
      type.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve no need to be afraid of me,&rsquo; I declared, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Truly? Even, if ... You said something about our relations.... But even
      if there were ...&rsquo; she broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even in that case, you would have no need to be afraid, Musa Pavlovna. I
      am not your judge. Your secret is buried here.&rsquo; I pointed to my bosom.
      &lsquo;Believe me, I know how to appreciate ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you got my letter?&rsquo; Musa asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In my pocket.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give it here ... quick, quick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I got out the scrap of paper. Musa snatched it in her rough little hand,
      stood still a moment facing me, as though she were going to thank me; but
      suddenly started, looked round, and without even a word at parting, ran
      quickly down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked in the direction she had taken. At no great distance from the
      tower I discerned, wrapped in an &lsquo;Almaviva&rsquo; (&lsquo;Almavivas&rsquo; were then in the
      height of fashion), a figure which I recognised at once as Tarhov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha, my boy,&rsquo; thought I, &lsquo;you must have had notice, then, since you&rsquo;re on
      the look-out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And whistling to myself, I started homewards.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I had only just drunk my morning tea, when Punin made his
      appearance. He came into my room with rather an embarrassed face, and
      began making bows, looking about him, and apologising for his intrusion,
      as he called it. I made haste to reassure him. I, sinful man, imagined
      that Punin had come with the intention of borrowing money. But he confined
      himself to asking for a glass of tea with rum in it, as, luckily, the
      samovar had not been cleared away. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s with some trepidation and sinking
      of heart that I have come to see you,&rsquo; he said, as he nibbled a lump of
      sugar. &lsquo;You I do not fear; but I stand in awe of your honoured
      grandmother! I am abashed too by my attire, as I have already communicated
      to you.&rsquo; Punin passed his finger along the frayed edge of his ancient
      coat. &lsquo;At home it&rsquo;s no matter, and in the street, too, it&rsquo;s no harm; but
      when one finds one&rsquo;s self in gilded palaces, one&rsquo;s poverty stares one in
      the face, and one feels confused!&rsquo; I occupied two small rooms on the
      ground floor, and certainly it would never have entered any one&rsquo;s head to
      call them palaces, still less gilded; but Punin apparently was referring
      to the whole of my grandmother&rsquo;s house, though that too was by no means
      conspicuously sumptuous. He reproached me for not having been to see them
      the previous day; &lsquo;Paramon Semyonitch,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;expected you, though he
      did declare that you would be sure not to come. And Musotchka, too,
      expected you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? Musa Pavlovna too?&rsquo; I queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She too. She&rsquo;s a charming girl we have got with us, isn&rsquo;t she? What do
      you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very charming,&rsquo; I assented. Punin rubbed his bare head with extraordinary
      rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a beauty, sir, a pearl or even a diamond&mdash;it&rsquo;s the truth I am
      telling you.&rsquo; He bent down quite to my ear. &lsquo;Noble blood, too,&rsquo; he
      whispered to me, &lsquo;only&mdash;you understand&mdash;left-handed; the
      forbidden fruit was eaten. Well, the parents died, the relations would do
      nothing for her, and flung her to the hazards of destiny, that&rsquo;s to say,
      despair, dying of hunger! But at that point Paramon Semyonitch steps
      forward, known as a deliverer from of old! He took her, clothed her and
      cared for her, brought up the poor nestling; and she has blossomed into
      our darling! I tell you, a man of the rarest qualities!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin subsided against the back of the armchair, lifted his hands, and
      again bending forward, began whispering again, but still more
      mysteriously: &lsquo;You see Paramon Semyonitch himself too.... Didn&rsquo;t you know?
      he too is of exalted extraction&mdash;and on the left side, too. They do
      say&mdash;his father was a powerful Georgian prince, of the line of King
      David.... What do you make of that? A few words&mdash;but how much is
      said? The blood of King David! What do you think of that? And according to
      other accounts, the founder of the family of Paramon Semyonitch was an
      Indian Shah, Babur. Blue blood! That&rsquo;s fine too, isn&rsquo;t it? Eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; I queried, &lsquo;and was he too, Baburin, flung to the hazards of
      destiny?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin rubbed his pate again. &lsquo;To be sure he was! And with even greater
      cruelty than our little lady! From his earliest childhood nothing but
      struggling! And, in fact, I will confess that, inspired by Ruban, I
      composed in allusion to this fact a stanza for the portrait of Paramon
      Semyonitch. Wait a bit ... how was it? Yes!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;E&rsquo;en from the cradle fate&rsquo;s remorseless blows
  Baburin drove towards the abyss of woes!
  But as in darkness gleams the light, so now
  The conqueror&rsquo;s laurel wreathes his noble brow!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Punin delivered these lines in a rhythmic, sing-song voice, with full
      rounded vowels, as verses should be read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So that&rsquo;s how it is he&rsquo;s a republican!&rsquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that&rsquo;s not why,&rsquo; Punin answered simply. &lsquo;He forgave his father long
      ago; but he cannot endure injustice of any sort; it&rsquo;s the sorrows of
      others that trouble him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to turn the conversation on what I had learned from Musa the day
      before, that is to say, on Baburin&rsquo;s matrimonial project,&mdash;but I did
      not know how to proceed. Punin himself got me out of the difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you notice nothing?&rsquo; he asked me suddenly, slily screwing up his
      eyes, &lsquo;while you were with us? nothing special?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, was there anything to notice?&rsquo; I asked in my turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin looked over his shoulder, as though anxious to satisfy himself that
      no one was listening. &lsquo;Our little beauty, Musotchka, is shortly to be a
      married lady!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madame Baburin,&rsquo; Punin announced with an effort, and slapping his knees
      several times with his open hands, he nodded his head, like a china
      mandarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo; I cried, with assumed astonishment. Punin&rsquo;s head slowly came
      to rest, and his hands dropped down. &lsquo;Why impossible, allow me to ask?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because Paramon Semyonitch is more fit to be your young lady&rsquo;s father;
      because such a difference in age excludes all likelihood of love&mdash;on
      the girl&rsquo;s side.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excludes?&rsquo; Punin repeated excitedly. &lsquo;But what about gratitude? and pure
      affection? and tenderness of feeling? Excludes! You must consider this:
      admitting that Musa&rsquo;s a splendid girl; but then to gain Paramon
      Semyonitch&rsquo;s affection, to be his comfort, his prop&mdash;his spouse, in
      short! is that not the loftiest possible happiness even for such a girl?
      And she realises it! You should look, turn an attentive eye! In Paramon
      Semyonitch&rsquo;s presence Musotchka is all veneration, all tremor and
      enthusiasm!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s wrong, Nikander Vavilitch, that she is, as you say,
      all tremor. If you love any one you don&rsquo;t feel tremors in their presence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But with that I can&rsquo;t agree! Here am I, for instance; no one, I suppose,
      could love Paramon Semyonitch more than I, but I ... tremble before him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you&mdash;that&rsquo;s a different matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is it a different matter? how? how?&rsquo; interrupted Punin. I simply did
      not know him; he got hot, and serious, almost angry, and quite dropped his
      rhythmic sing-song in speaking. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he declared; &lsquo;I notice that you have
      not a good eye for character! No; you can&rsquo;t read people&rsquo;s hearts!&rsquo; I gave
      up contradicting him ... and to give another turn to the conversation,
      proposed, for the sake of old times, that we should read something
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin was silent for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of the old poets? The real ones?&rsquo; he asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; a new one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A new one?&rsquo; Punin repeated mistrustfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pushkin,&rsquo; I answered. I suddenly thought of the <i>Gypsies</i> which
      Tarhov had mentioned not long before. There, by the way, is the ballad
      about the old husband. Punin grumbled a little, but I sat him down on the
      sofa, so that he could listen more comfortably, and began to read
      Pushkin&rsquo;s poem. The passage came at last, &lsquo;old husband, cruel husband&rsquo;;
      Punin heard the ballad through to the end, and all at once he got up
      impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he pronounced, with an intense emotion, which impressed even
      me;&mdash;&lsquo;excuse me; I cannot hear more of that author. He is an immoral
      slanderer; he is a liar ... he upsets me. I cannot! Permit me to cut short
      my visit to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I began trying to persuade Punin to remain; but he insisted on having his
      own way with a sort of stupid, scared obstinacy: he repeated several times
      that he felt upset, and wished to get a breath of fresh air&mdash;and all
      the while his lips were faintly quivering and his eyes avoided mine, as
      though I had wounded him. So he went away. A little while after, I too
      went out of the house and set off to see Tarhov.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Without inquiring of any one, with a student&rsquo;s usual lack of ceremony, I
      walked straight into his lodgings. In the first room there was no one. I
      called Tarhov by name, and receiving no answer, was just going to retreat;
      but the door of the adjoining room opened, and my friend appeared. He
      looked at me rather queerly, and shook hands without speaking. I had come
      to him to repeat all I had heard from Punin; and though I felt at once
      that I had called on Tarhov at the wrong moment, still, after talking a
      little about extraneous matters, I ended by informing him of Baburin&rsquo;s
      intentions in regard to Musa. This piece of news did not, apparently,
      surprise him much; he quietly sat down at the table, and fixing his eyes
      intently upon me, and keeping silent as before, gave to his features an
      expression ... an expression, as though he would say: &lsquo;Well, what more
      have you to tell? Come, out with your ideas!&rsquo; I looked more attentively
      into his face.... It struck me as eager, a little ironical, a little
      arrogant even. But that did not hinder me from bringing out my ideas. On
      the contrary. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re showing off,&rsquo; was my thought; &lsquo;so I am not going to
      spare you!&rsquo; And there and then I proceeded straightway to enlarge upon the
      mischief of yielding to impulsive feelings, upon the duty of every man to
      respect the freedom and personal life of another man&mdash;in short, I
      proceeded to enunciate useful and appropriate counsel. Holding forth in
      this manner, I walked up and down the room, to be more at ease. Tarhov did
      not interrupt me, and did not stir from his seat; he only played with his
      fingers on his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said I ... (Exactly what was my motive in speaking so, I have no
      clear idea myself&mdash;envy, most likely; it was not devotion to
      morality, anyway!) &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that it&rsquo;s no easy matter, no joking
      matter; I am sure you love Musa, and that Musa loves you&mdash;that it is
      not a passing fancy on your part.... But, see, let us suppose! (Here I
      folded my arms on my breast.) ... Let us suppose you gratify your passion&mdash;what
      is to follow? You won&rsquo;t marry her, you know. And at the same time you are
      wrecking the happiness of an excellent, honest man, her benefactor&mdash;and&mdash;who
      knows? (here my face expressed at the same time penetration and sorrow)&mdash;possibly
      her own happiness too....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And so on, and so on!
    </p>
    <p>
      For about a quarter of an hour my discourse flowed on. Tarhov was still
      silent. I began to be disconcerted by this silence. I glanced at him from
      time to time, not so much to satisfy myself as to the impression my words
      were making on him, as to find out why he neither objected nor agreed, but
      sat like a deaf mute. At last I fancied that there was ... yes, there
      certainly was a change in his face. It began to show signs of uneasiness,
      agitation, painful agitation.... Yet, strange to say, the eager, bright,
      laughing something, which had struck me at my first glance at Tarhov,
      still did not leave that agitated, that troubled face! I could not make up
      my mind whether or no to congratulate myself on the success of my sermon,
      when Tarhov suddenly got up, and pressing both my hands, said, speaking
      very quickly, &lsquo;Thank you, thank you. You&rsquo;re right, of course, ... though,
      on the other side, one might observe ... What is your Baburin you make so
      much of, after all? An honest fool&mdash;and nothing more! You call him a
      republican&mdash;and he&rsquo;s simply a fool! Oo! That&rsquo;s what he is! All his
      republicanism simply means that he can never get on anywhere!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! so that&rsquo;s your idea! A fool! can never get on!&mdash;but let me tell
      you,&rsquo; I pursued, with sudden heat, &lsquo;let me tell you, my dear Vladimir
      Nikolaitch, that in these days to get on nowhere is a sign of a fine, a
      noble nature! None but worthless people&mdash;bad people&mdash;get on
      anywhere and accommodate themselves to everything. You say Baburin is an
      honest fool! Why, is it better, then, to your mind, to be dishonest and
      clever?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You distort my words!&rsquo; cried Tarhov. &lsquo;I only wanted to explain how I
      understand that person. Do you think he&rsquo;s such a rare specimen? Not a bit
      of it! I&rsquo;ve met other people like him in my time. A man sits with an air
      of importance, silent, obstinate, angular.... O-ho-ho! say you. It shows
      that there&rsquo;s a great deal in him! But there&rsquo;s nothing in him, not one idea
      in his head&mdash;nothing but a sense of his own dignity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even if there is nothing else, that&rsquo;s an honourable thing,&rsquo; I broke in.
      &lsquo;But let me ask where you have managed to study him like this? You don&rsquo;t
      know him, do you? Or are you describing him ... from what Musa tells you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarhov shrugged his shoulders. &lsquo;Musa and I ... have other things to talk
      of. I tell you what,&rsquo; he added, his whole body quivering with impatience,&mdash;&lsquo;I
      tell you what: if Baburin has such a noble and honest nature, how is it he
      doesn&rsquo;t see that Musa is not a fit match for him? It&rsquo;s one of two things:
      either he knows that what he&rsquo;s doing to her is something of the nature of
      an outrage, all in the name of gratitude ... and if so, what about his
      honesty?&mdash;or he doesn&rsquo;t realise it ... and in that case, what can one
      call him but a fool?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was about to reply, but Tarhov again clutched my hands, and again began
      talking in a hurried voice. &lsquo;Though ... of course ... I confess you are
      right, a thousand times right.... You are a true friend ... but now leave
      me alone, please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was puzzled. &lsquo;Leave you alone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I must, don&rsquo;t you see, think over all you&rsquo;ve just said,
      thoroughly.... I have no doubt you are right ... but now leave me alone!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You &lsquo;re in such a state of excitement ...&rsquo; I was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Excitement? I?&rsquo; Tarhov laughed, but instantly pulled himself up. &lsquo;Yes, of
      course I am. How could I help being? You say yourself it&rsquo;s no joking
      matter. Yes; I must think about it ... alone.&rsquo; He was still squeezing my
      hands. &lsquo;Good-bye, my dear fellow, good-bye!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo; I repeated. &lsquo;Good-bye, old boy!&rsquo; As I was going away I flung a
      last glance at Tarhov. He seemed pleased. At what? At the fact that I,
      like a true friend and comrade, had pointed out the danger of the way upon
      which he had set his foot&mdash;or that I was going? Ideas of the most
      diverse kind were floating in my head the whole day till evening&mdash;till
      the very instant when I entered the house occupied by Punin and Baburin,
      for I went to see them the same day. I am bound to confess that some of
      Tarhov&rsquo;s phrases had sunk deep into my soul ... and were ringing in my
      ears.... In truth, was it possible Baburin ... was it possible he did not
      see she was not a fit match for him?
    </p>
    <p>
      But could this possibly be: Baburin, the self-sacrificing Baburin&mdash;an
      honest fool!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin had said, when he came to see me, that I had been expected there the
      day before. That may have been so, but on this day, it is certain, no one
      expected me.... I found every one at home, and every one was surprised at
      my visit. Baburin and Punin were both unwell: Punin had a headache, and he
      was lying curled up on the sofa, with his head tied up in a spotted
      handkerchief, and strips of cucumber applied to his temples. Baburin was
      suffering from a bilious attack; all yellow, almost dusky, with dark rings
      round his eyes, with scowling brow and unshaven chin&mdash;he did not look
      much like a bridegroom! I tried to go away.... But they would not let me
      go, and even made tea. I spent anything but a cheerful evening. Musa, it
      is true, had no ailment, and was less shy than usual too, but she was
      obviously vexed, angry.... At last she could not restrain herself, and, as
      she handed me a cup of tea, she whispered hurriedly: &lsquo;You can say what you
      like, you may try your utmost, you won&rsquo;t make any difference.... So
      there!&rsquo; I looked at her in astonishment, and, seizing a favourable moment,
      asked her, also in a whisper, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of your words?&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
      tell you,&rsquo; she answered, and her black eyes, gleaming angrily under her
      frowning brows, were fastened for an instant on my face, and turned away
      at once: &lsquo;the meaning is that I heard all you said there to-day, and thank
      you for nothing, and things won&rsquo;t be as you &lsquo;d have them, anyway.&rsquo; &lsquo;You
      were there,&rsquo; broke from me unconsciously.... But at this point Baburin&rsquo;s
      attention was caught, and he glanced in our direction. Musa walked away
      from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later she managed to come near me again. She seemed to enjoy
      saying bold and dangerous things to me, and saying them in the presence of
      her protector, under his vigilant eye, only exercising barely enough
      caution not to arouse his suspicions. It is well known that walking on the
      brink, on the very edge, of the precipice is woman&rsquo;s favourite pastime.
      &lsquo;Yes, I was there,&rsquo; whispered Musa, without any change of countenance,
      except that her nostrils were faintly quivering and her lips twitching.
      &lsquo;Yes, and if Paramon Semyonitch asks me what I am whispering about with
      you, I&rsquo;d tell him this minute. What do I care?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be more careful,&rsquo; I besought her. &lsquo;I really believe they are noticing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you, I&rsquo;m quite ready to tell them everything. And who&rsquo;s noticing?
      One&rsquo;s stretching his neck off the pillow, like a sick duck, and hears
      nothing; and the other&rsquo;s deep in philosophy. Don&rsquo;t you be afraid!&rsquo; Musa&rsquo;s
      voice rose a little, and her cheeks gradually flushed a sort of malignant,
      dusky red; and this suited her marvellously, and never had she been so
      pretty. As she cleared the table, and set the cups and saucers in their
      places, she moved swiftly about the room; there was something challenging
      about her light, free and easy movement. &lsquo;You may criticise me as you
      like,&rsquo; she seemed to say; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m going my own way, and I&rsquo;m not afraid of
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot disguise the fact that I found Musa bewitching just that evening.
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I mused; &lsquo;she&rsquo;s a little spitfire&mdash;she&rsquo;s a new type.... She&rsquo;s&mdash;exquisite.
      Those hands know how to deal a blow, I dare say.... What of it! No
      matter!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Paramon Semyonitch,&rsquo; she cried suddenly, &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t a republic an empire in
      which every one does as he chooses?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A republic is not an empire,&rsquo; answered Baburin, raising his head, and
      contracting his brows; &lsquo;it is a ... form of society in which everything
      rests on law and justice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; Musa pursued, &lsquo;in a republic no one can oppress any one else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And every one is free to dispose of himself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s all I wanted to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you want to know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I wanted to&mdash;I wanted <i>you</i> to tell me that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our young lady is anxious to learn,&rsquo; Punin observed from the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went out into the passage Musa accompanied me, not, of course, from
      politeness, but with the same malicious intent. I asked her, as I took
      leave, &lsquo;Can you really love him so much?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whether I love him, or whether I don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s <i>my</i> affair,&rsquo; she
      answered. &lsquo;What is to be, will be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind what you&rsquo;re about; don&rsquo;t play with fire ... you&rsquo;ll get burnt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better be burnt than frozen. You ... with your good advice! And how can
      you tell he won&rsquo;t marry me? How do you know I so particularly want to get
      married? If I am ruined ... what business is it of yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She slammed the door after me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember that on the way home I reflected with some pleasure that my
      friend Vladimir Tarhov might find things rather hot for him with his new
      type.... He ought to have to pay something for his happiness!
    </p>
    <p>
      That he would be happy, I was&mdash;regretfully&mdash;unable to doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days passed by. I was sitting in my room at my writing-table, and
      not so much working as getting myself ready for lunch.... I heard a
      rustle, lifted my head, and I was stupefied. Before me&mdash;rigid,
      terrible, white as chalk, stood an apparition ... Punin. His half-closed
      eyes were looking at me, blinking slowly; they expressed a senseless
      terror, the terror of a frightened hare, and his arms hung at his sides
      like sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nikander Vavilitch! what is the matter with you? How did you come here?
      Did no one see you? What has happened? Do speak!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has run away,&rsquo; Punin articulated in a hoarse, hardly audible voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has run away,&rsquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Musa. She went away in the night, and left a note.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A note?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I am not coming back again. Don&rsquo;t look
      for me.&rdquo; We ran up and down; we questioned the cook; she knew nothing. I
      can&rsquo;t speak loud; you must excuse me. I&rsquo;ve lost my voice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Musa Pavlovna has left you!&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;Nonsense! Mr. Baburin must be
      in despair. What does he intend to do now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has no intention of doing anything. I wanted to run to the
      Governor-general: he forbade it. I wanted to give information to the
      police; he forbade that too, and got very angry. He says, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s free.&rdquo; He
      says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to constrain her.&rdquo; He has even gone to work, to his
      office. But he looks more dead than alive. He loved her terribly....Oh,
      oh, we both loved her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Punin for the first time showed that he was not a wooden image, but a
      live man; he lifted both his fists in the air, and brought them down on
      his pate, which shone like ivory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ungrateful girl!&rsquo; he groaned; &lsquo;who was it gave you food and drink,
      clothed you, and brought you up? who cared for you, would have given all
      his life, all his soul ... And you have forgotten it all? To cast me off,
      truly, were no great matter, but Paramon Semyonitch, Paramon ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I begged him to sit down, to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin shook his head. &lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. I have come to you ... I don&rsquo;t know
      what for. I&rsquo;m like one distraught; to stay at home alone is fearful; what
      am I to do with myself? I stand in the middle of the room, shut my eyes,
      and call, &ldquo;Musa! Musotchka!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the way to go out of one&rsquo;s mind. But
      no, why am I talking nonsense? I know why I have come to you. You know,
      the other day you read me that thrice-accursed poem ... you remember,
      where there is talk of an old husband. What did you do that for? Did you
      know something then ... or guessed something?&rsquo; Punin glanced at me. &lsquo;Piotr
      Petrovitch,&rsquo; he cried suddenly, and he began trembling all over, &lsquo;you
      know, perhaps, where she is. Kind friend, tell me whom she has gone to!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was disconcerted, and could not help dropping my eyes....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps she said something in her letter,&rsquo; I began....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She said she was leaving us because she loved some one else! Dear, good
      friend, you know, surely, where she is? Save her, let us go to her; we
      will persuade her. Only think what a man she&rsquo;s bringing to ruin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin all at once flushed crimson, the blood seemed to rush to his head,
      he plumped heavily down on his knees. &lsquo;Save us, friend, let us go to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My servant appeared in the doorway, and stood still in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had no little trouble to get Punin on to his feet again, to convince him
      that, even if I did suspect something, still it would not do to act like
      that, on the spur of the moment, especially both together&mdash;that would
      only spoil all our efforts&mdash;that I was ready to do my best, but would
      not answer for anything. Punin did not oppose me, nor did he indeed hear
      me; he only repeated from time to time in his broken voice, &lsquo;Save her,
      save her and Paramon Semyonitch.&rsquo; At last he began to cry. &lsquo;Tell me at
      least one thing,&rsquo; he asked ... &lsquo;is <i>he</i> handsome, young?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he is young,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is young,&rsquo; repeated Punin, smearing the tears over his cheeks; &lsquo;and
      she is young.... It&rsquo;s from that that all the trouble&rsquo;s sprung!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This rhyme came by chance; poor Punin was in no mood for versifying. I
      would have given a good deal to hear his rhapsodical eloquence again, or
      even his almost noiseless laugh.... Alas! his eloquence was quenched for
      ever, and I never heard his laugh again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promised to let him know, as soon as I should find out anything
      positive.... Tarhov&rsquo;s name I did not, however, mention. Punin suddenly
      collapsed completely. &lsquo;Very good, very good, sir, thank you,&rsquo; he said with
      a pitiful face, using the word &lsquo;sir,&rsquo; which he had never done before;
      &lsquo;only mind, sir, do not say anything to Paramon Semyonitch ... or he&rsquo;ll be
      angry. In one word, he has forbidden it. Good-bye, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he got up and turned his back to me, Punin struck me as such a poor
      feeble creature, that I positively marvelled; he limped with both legs,
      and doubled up at each step....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a bad look-out. It&rsquo;s the end of him, that&rsquo;s what it means,&rsquo; I
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I had promised Punin to trace Musa, yet as I set off the same day
      to Tarhov&rsquo;s, I had not the slightest expectation of learning anything, as
      I considered it certain that either I should not find him at home, or that
      he would refuse to see me. My supposition turned out to be a mistaken one.
      I found Tarhov at home; he received me, and I found out indeed all I
      wanted to know; but there was nothing gained by that. Directly I crossed
      the threshold of his door, Tarhov came resolutely, rapidly, to meet me,
      and his eyes sparkling and glowing, his face grown handsomer and radiant,
      he said firmly and briskly: &lsquo;Listen, Petya, my boy; I guess what you&rsquo;ve
      come for, and what you want to talk about; but I give you warning, if you
      say a single word about her, or about her action, or about what, according
      to you, is the course dictated to me by common sense, we&rsquo;re friends no
      longer, we&rsquo;re not even acquainted, and I shall beg you to treat me as a
      stranger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Tarhov; he was quivering all over inwardly, like a tightly
      drawn harpstring; he was tingling all over, hardly could he hold back the
      tide of brimming youth and passion; violent, ecstatic happiness had burst
      into his soul, and had taken full possession of him&mdash;and he of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that your final decision?&rsquo; I pronounced mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Petya, my boy, it&rsquo;s final.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case, there&rsquo;s nothing for me but to say good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarhov faintly dropped his eyelids.... He was too happy at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, Petya, old boy,&rsquo; he said, a little through his nose, with a
      candid smile and a gay flash of all his white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was I to do? I left him to his &lsquo;happiness.&rsquo; As I slammed the door
      after me, the other door of the room slammed also&mdash;I heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a heavy heart that I trudged off next day to see my luckless
      acquaintances. I secretly hoped&mdash;such is human weakness&mdash;that I
      should not find them at home, and again I was mistaken. Both were at home.
      The change that had taken place in them during the last three days must
      have struck any one. Punin looked ghastly white and flabby. His
      talkativeness had completely vanished. He spoke listlessly, feebly, still
      in the same husky voice, and looked somehow lost and bewildered. Baburin,
      on the contrary, seemed shrunk into himself, and blacker than ever;
      taciturn at the best of times, he uttered nothing now but a few abrupt
      sounds; an expression of stony severity seemed to have frozen on his
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt it impossible to be silent; but what was there to say? I confined
      myself to whispering to Punin, &lsquo;I have discovered nothing, and my advice
      to you is to give up all hope.&rsquo; Punin glanced at me with his swollen, red
      little eyes&mdash;the only red left in his face&mdash;muttered something
      inaudible, and hobbled away. Baburin most likely guessed what I had been
      speaking about to Punin, and opening his lips, which were tightly
      compressed, as though glued together, he pronounced, in a deliberate
      voice, &lsquo;My dear sir, since your last visit to us, something disagreeable
      has happened to us; our young friend, Musa Pavlovna Vinogradov, finding it
      no longer convenient to live with us, has decided to leave us, and has
      given us a written communication to that effect. Not considering that we
      have any right to hinder her doing so, we have left her to act according
      to her own views of what is best. We trust that she may be happy,&rsquo; he
      added, with some effort; &lsquo;and I humbly beg you not to allude to the
      subject, as any such references are useless, and even painful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he too, like Tarhov, forbids my speaking of Musa,&rsquo; was the thought
      that struck me, and I could not help wondering inwardly. He might well
      prize Zeno so highly. I wished to impart to him some facts about that
      sage, but my tongue would not form the words, and it did well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon went about my business. At parting neither Punin nor Baburin said,
      &lsquo;Till we meet!&rsquo; both with one voice pronounced, &lsquo;Good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Punin even returned me a volume of the <i>Telegraph</i> I had brought him,
      as much as to say, &lsquo;he had no need of anything of that kind now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later I had a curious encounter. An early spring had set in
      abruptly; at midday the heat rose to eighteen degrees Réaumur. Everything
      was turning green, and shooting up out of the spongy, damp earth. I hired
      a horse at the riding-school, and went out for a ride into the outskirts
      of the town, towards the Vorobyov hills. On the road I was met by a little
      cart, drawn by a pair of spirited ponies, splashed with mud up to their
      ears, with plaited tails, and red ribbons in their manes and forelocks.
      Their harness was such as sportsmen affect, with copper discs and tassels;
      they were being driven by a smart young driver, in a blue tunic without
      sleeves, a yellow striped silk shirt, and a low felt hat with peacock&rsquo;s
      feathers round the crown. Beside him sat a girl of the artisan or merchant
      class, in a flowered silk jacket, with a big blue handkerchief on her head&mdash;and
      she was simply bubbling over with mirth. The driver was laughing too. I
      drew my horse on one side, but did not, however, take particular notice of
      the swiftly passing, merry couple, when, all at once, the young man
      shouted to his ponies.... Why, that was Tarhov&rsquo;s voice! I looked round....
      Yes, it was he; unmistakably he, dressed up as a peasant, and beside him&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t
      it Musa?
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that instant their ponies quickened their pace, and they were out
      of my sight in a minute. I tried to put my horse into a gallop in pursuit
      of them, but it was an old riding school hack, that shambled from side to
      side as it moved; it went more slowly galloping than trotting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enjoy yourselves, my dear friends!&rsquo; I muttered through my teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ought to observe that I had not seen Tarhov during the whole week,
      though I had been three times to his rooms. He was never at home. Baburin
      and Punin I had not seen either.... I had not been to see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I caught cold on my ride; though it was very warm, there was a piercing
      wind. I was dangerously ill, and when I recovered I went with my
      grandmother into the country &lsquo;to feed up,&rsquo; by the doctor&rsquo;s advice. I did
      not get to Moscow again; in the autumn I was transferred to the Petersburg
      university.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      1849
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not seven, but fully twelve years had passed by, and I was in my
      thirty-second year. My grandmother had long been dead; I was living in
      Petersburg, with a post in the Department of Home Affairs. Tarhov I had
      lost sight of; he had gone into the army, and lived almost always in the
      provinces. We had met twice, as old friends, glad to see each other; but
      we had not touched on the past in our talk. At the time of our last
      meeting he was, if I remember right, already a married man.
    </p>
    <p>
      One sultry summer day I was sauntering along Gorohov Street, cursing my
      official duties for keeping me in Petersburg, and the heat and stench and
      dust of the city. A funeral barred my way. It consisted of a solitary car,
      that is, to be accurate, of a decrepit hearse, on which a poor-looking
      wooden coffin, half-covered with a threadbare black cloth, was shaking up
      and down as it was jolted violently over the uneven pavement. An old man
      with a white head was walking alone after the hearse.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him.... His face seemed familiar.... He too turned his eyes
      upon me.... Merciful heavens! it was Baburin! I took off my hat, went up
      to him, mentioned my name, and walked along beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whom are you burying?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nikander Vavilitch Punin,&rsquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt, I knew beforehand, that he would utter that name, and yet it set
      my heart aching. I felt melancholy, and yet I was glad that chance had
      enabled me to pay my last respects to my old friend....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I go with you, Paramon Semyonitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may.... I was following him alone; now there&rsquo;ll be two of us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our walk lasted more than an hour. My companion moved forward, without
      lifting his eyes or opening his lips. He had become quite an old man since
      I had seen him last; his deeply furrowed, copper-coloured face stood out
      sharply against his white hair. Signs of a life of toil and suffering, of
      continual struggle, could be seen in Baburin&rsquo;s whole figure; want and
      poverty had worked cruel havoc with him. When everything was over, when
      what was Punin had disappeared for ever in the damp ... yes, undoubtedly
      damp earth of the Smolensky cemetery, Baburin, after standing a couple of
      minutes with bowed, uncovered head before the newly risen mound of sandy
      clay, turned to me his emaciated, as it were embittered, face, his dry,
      sunken eyes, thanked me grimly, and was about to move away; but I detained
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where do you live, Paramon Semyonitch? Let me come and see you. I had no
      idea you were living in Petersburg. We could recall old days, and talk of
      our dead friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Baburin did not answer me at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s two years since I found my way to Petersburg,&rsquo; he observed at last;
      &lsquo;I live at the very end of the town. However, if you really care to visit
      me, come.&rsquo; He gave me his address. &lsquo;Come in the evening; in the evening we
      are always at home ... both of us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Both of you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am married. My wife is not very well to-day, and that&rsquo;s why she did not
      come too. Though, indeed, it&rsquo;s quite enough for one person to go through
      this empty formality, this ceremony. As if anybody believed in it all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a little surprised at Baburin&rsquo;s last words, but I said nothing,
      called a cab, and proposed to Baburin to take him home; but he refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day I went in the evening to see him. All the way there I was
      thinking of Punin. I recalled how I had met him the first time, and how
      ecstatic and amusing he was in those days; and afterwards in Moscow how
      subdued he had grown&mdash;especially the last time I saw him; and now he
      had made his last reckoning with life;&mdash;life is in grim earnest, it
      seems! Baburin was living in the Viborgsky quarter, in a little house
      which reminded me of the Moscow &lsquo;nest&rsquo;: the Petersburg abode was almost
      shabbier in appearance. When I went into his room he was sitting on a
      chair in a corner with his hands on his knees; a tallow candle, burning
      low, dimly lighted up his bowed, white head. He heard the sound of my
      footsteps, started up, and welcomed me more warmly than I had expected. A
      few moments later his wife came in; I recognised her at once as Musa&mdash;and
      only then understood why Baburin had invited me to come; he wanted to show
      me that he had after all come by his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musa was greatly changed&mdash;in face, in voice, and in manners; but her
      eyes were changed most of all. In old times they had darted about like
      live creatures, those malicious, beautiful eyes; they had gleamed
      stealthily, but brilliantly; their glance had pierced, like a
      pin-prick.... Now they looked at one directly, calmly, steadily; their
      black centres had lost their lustre. &lsquo;I am broken in, I am tame, I am
      good,&rsquo; her soft and dull gaze seemed to say. Her continued, submissive
      smile told the same story. And her dress, too, was subdued; brown, with
      little spots on it. She came up to me, asked me whether I knew her. She
      obviously felt no embarrassment, and not because she had lost a sense of
      shame or memory of the past, but simply because all petty
      self-consciousness had left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musa talked a great deal about Punin, talked in an even voice, which too
      had lost its fire. I learned that of late years he had become very feeble,
      had almost sunk into childishness, so much so that he was miserable if he
      had not toys to play with; they persuaded him, it is true, that he made
      them out of waste stuff for sale ... but he really played with them
      himself. His passion for poetry, however, never died out, and he kept his
      memory for nothing but verses; a few days before his death he recited a
      passage from the <i>Rossiad</i>; but Pushkin he feared, as children fear
      bogies. His devotion to Baburin had also remained undiminished; he
      worshipped him as much as ever, and even at the last, wrapped about by the
      chill and dark of the end, he had faltered with halting tongue,
      &lsquo;benefactor!&rsquo; I learned also from Musa that soon after the Moscow episode,
      it had been Baburin&rsquo;s fate once more to wander all over Russia,
      continually tossed from one private situation to another; that in
      Petersburg, too, he had been again in a situation, in a private business,
      which situation he had, however, been obliged to leave a few days before,
      owing to some unpleasantness with his employer: Baburin had ventured to
      stand up for the workpeople.... The invariable smile, with which Musa
      accompanied her words, set me musing mournfully; it put the finishing
      touch to the impression made on me by her husband&rsquo;s appearance. They had
      hard work, the two of them, to make a bare living&mdash;there was no doubt
      of it. He took very little part in our conversation; he seemed more
      preoccupied than grieved.... Something was worrying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Paramon Semyonitch, come here,&rsquo; said the cook, suddenly appearing in the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it? what&rsquo;s wanted?&rsquo; he asked in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come here,&rsquo; the cook repeated insistently and meaningly. Baburin buttoned
      up his coat and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was left alone with Musa, she looked at me with a somewhat changed
      glance, and observed in a voice which was also changed, and with no smile:
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Piotr Petrovitch, what you think of me now, but I dare say
      you remember what I used to be.... I was self-confident, light-hearted ...
      and not good; I wanted to live for my own pleasure. But I want to tell you
      this: when I was abandoned, and was like one lost, and was only waiting
      for God to take me, or to pluck up spirit to make an end of myself,&mdash;once
      more, just as in Voronezh, I met with Paramon Semyonitch&mdash;and he
      saved me once again.... Not a word that could wound me did I hear from
      him, not a word of reproach; he asked nothing of me&mdash;I was not worthy
      of that; but he loved me ... and I became his wife. What was I to do? I
      had failed of dying; and I could not live either after my own
      choice....What was I to do with myself? Even so&mdash;it was a mercy to be
      thankful for. That is all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She ceased, turned away for an instant ... the same submissive smile came
      back to her lips. &lsquo;Whether life&rsquo;s easy for me, you needn&rsquo;t ask,&rsquo; was the
      meaning I fancied now in that smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation passed to ordinary subjects. Musa told me that Punin had
      left a cat that he had been very fond of, and that ever since his death
      she had gone up to the attic and stayed there, mewing incessantly, as
      though she were calling some one ... the neighbours were very much scared,
      and fancied that it was Punin&rsquo;s soul that had passed into the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Paramon Semyonitch is worried about something,&rsquo; I said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you noticed it?&rsquo;&mdash;Musa sighed. &lsquo;He cannot help being worried. I
      need hardly tell you that Paramon Semyonitch has remained faithful to his
      principles.... The present condition of affairs can but strengthen them.&rsquo; 
      (Musa expressed herself quite differently now from in the old days in
      Moscow; there was a literary, bookish flavour in her phrases.) &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know, though, whether I can rely upon you, and how you will receive ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should you imagine you cannot rely upon me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you are in the government service&mdash;you are an official.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what of that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are, consequently, loyal to the government.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I marvelled inwardly ... at Musa&rsquo;s innocence. &lsquo;As to my attitude to the
      government, which is not even aware of my existence, I won&rsquo;t enlarge upon
      that,&rsquo; I observed; &lsquo;but you may set your mind at rest. I will make no bad
      use of your confidence. I sympathise with your husband&rsquo;s ideas ... more
      than you suppose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Musa shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s all so,&rsquo; she began, not without hesitation; &lsquo;but you see it&rsquo;s
      like this. Paramon Semyonitch&rsquo;s ideas will shortly, it may be, find
      expression in action. They can no longer be hidden under a bushel. There
      are comrades whom we cannot now abandon ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Musa suddenly ceased speaking, as though she had bitten her tongue. Her
      last words had amazed and a little alarmed me. Most likely my face showed
      what I was feeling&mdash;and Musa noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have said already, our interview took place in the year 1849. Many
      people still remember what a disturbed and difficult time that was, and by
      what incidents it was signalised in St. Petersburg. I had been struck
      myself by certain peculiarities in Baburin&rsquo;s behaviour, in his whole
      demeanour. Twice he had referred to governmental action, to personages in
      high authority, with such intense bitterness and hatred, with such
      loathing, that I had been dumbfoundered....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; he asked me suddenly: &lsquo;did you set your peasants free?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to confess I had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I suppose your granny&rsquo;s dead, isn&rsquo;t she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to admit that she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure, you noble gentlemen,&rsquo; Baburin muttered between his teeth,
      &lsquo;... use other men&rsquo;s hands ... to poke up your fire ... that&rsquo;s what you
      like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the most conspicuous place in his room hung the well-known lithograph
      portrait of Belinsky; on the table lay a volume of the old <i>Polar Star</i>,
      edited by Bestuzhev.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long time passed, and Baburin did not come back after the cook had
      called him away. Musa looked several times uneasily towards the door by
      which he had gone out. At last she could bear it no longer; she got up,
      and with an apology she too went out by the same door. A quarter of an
      hour later she came back with her husband; the faces of both, so at least
      I thought, looked troubled. But all of a sudden Baburin&rsquo;s face assumed a
      different, an intensely bitter, almost frenzied expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What will be the end of it?&rsquo; he began all at once in a jerky, sobbing
      voice, utterly unlike him, while his wild eyes shifted restlessly about
      him. &lsquo;One goes on living and living, and hoping that maybe it&rsquo;ll be
      better, that one will breathe more freely; but it&rsquo;s quite the other way&mdash;everything
      gets worse and worse! They have <i>squeezed</i> us right up to the wall!
      In my youth I bore all with patience; they ... maybe ... beat me ... even
      ... yes!&rsquo; he added, turning sharply round on his heels and swooping down
      as it were, upon me: &lsquo;I, a man of full age, was subjected to corporal
      punishment ... yes;&mdash;of other wrongs I will not speak.... But is
      there really nothing before us but to go back to those old times again?
      The way they are treating the young people now! ... Yes, it breaks down
      all endurance at last.... It breaks it down! Yes! Wait a bit!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never seen Baburin in such a condition. Musa turned positively
      white.... Baburin suddenly cleared his throat, and sank down into a seat.
      Not wishing to constrain either him or Musa by my presence, I decided to
      go, and was just saying good-bye to them, when the door into the next room
      suddenly opened, and a head appeared.... It was not the cook&rsquo;s head, but
      the dishevelled and terrified-looking head of a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong, Baburin, something&rsquo;s wrong!&rsquo; he faltered hurriedly,
      then vanished at once on perceiving my unfamiliar figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baburin rushed after the young man. I pressed Musa&rsquo;s hand warmly, and
      withdrew, with presentiments of evil in my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come to-morrow,&rsquo; she whispered anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I certainly will come,&rsquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still in bed next morning, when my man handed me a letter from Musa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Piotr Petrovitch!&rsquo; she wrote: &lsquo;Paramon Semyonitch has been this
      night arrested by the police and carried off to the fortress, or I don&rsquo;t
      know where; they did not tell me. They ransacked all our papers, sealed up
      a great many, and took them away with them. It has been the same with our
      books and letters. They say a mass of people have been arrested in the
      town. You can fancy how I feel. It is well Nikander Vavilitch did not live
      to see it! He was taken just in time. Advise me what I am to do. For
      myself I am not afraid&mdash;I shall not die of starvation&mdash;but the
      thought of Paramon Semyonitch gives me no rest. Come, please, if only you
      are not afraid to visit people in our position.&mdash;Yours faithfully,
    </p>
    <h3>
      MUSA BABURIN.&rsquo; 
    </h3>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later I was with Musa. On seeing me she held out her hand,
      and, though she did not utter a word, a look of gratitude flitted over her
      face. She was wearing the same clothes as on the previous day; there was
      every sign that she had not been to bed or slept all night. Her eyes were
      red, but from sleeplessness, not from tears. She had not been crying. She
      was in no mood for weeping. She wanted to act, wanted to struggle with the
      calamity that had fallen upon them: the old, energetic, self-willed Musa
      had risen up in her again. She had no time even to be indignant, though
      she was choking with indignation. How to assist Baburin, to whom to appeal
      so as to soften his lot&mdash;she could think of nothing else. She wanted
      to go instantly, ... to petition, ... demand.... But where to go, whom to
      petition, what to demand&mdash;this was what she wanted to hear from me,
      this was what she wanted to consult me about.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began by counselling her ... to have patience. For the first moment
      there was nothing left to be done but to wait, and, as far as might be, to
      make inquiries; and to take any decisive step now when the affair had
      scarcely begun, and hardly yet taken shape, would be simply senseless,
      irrational. To hope for any success was irrational, even if I had been a
      person of much more importance and influence, ... but what could I, a
      petty official, do? As for her, she was absolutely without any powerful
      friends....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no easy matter to make all this plain to her ... but at last she
      understood my arguments; she understood, too, that I was not prompted by
      egoistic feeling, when I showed her the uselessness of all efforts. &lsquo;But
      tell me, Musa Pavlovna,&rsquo; I began, when she sank at last into a chair (till
      then she had been standing up, as though on the point of setting off at
      once to the aid of Baburin), &lsquo;how Paramon Semyonitch, at his age, comes to
      be mixed up in such an affair? I feel sure that there are none but young
      people implicated in it, like the one who came in yesterday to warn
      you....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those young people are our friends!&rsquo; cried Musa, and her eyes flashed and
      darted as of old. Something strong, irrepressible, seemed, as it were, to
      rise up from the bottom of her soul, ... and I suddenly recalled the
      expression &lsquo;a new type,&rsquo; which Tarhov had once used of her. &lsquo;Years are of
      no consequence when it is a matter of political principles!&rsquo; Musa laid a
      special stress on these last two words. One might fancy that in all her
      sorrow it was not unpleasing to her to show herself before me in this new,
      unlooked-for character&mdash;in the character of a cultivated and mature
      woman, fit wife of a republican! ... &lsquo;Some old men are younger than some
      young ones,&rsquo; she pursued, &lsquo;more capable of sacrifice.... But that&rsquo;s not
      the point.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think, Musa Pavlovna,&rsquo; I observed, &lsquo;that you are exaggerating a little.
      Knowing the character of Paramon Semyonitch, I should have felt sure
      beforehand that he would sympathise with every ... sincere impulse; but,
      on the other hand, I have always regarded him as a man of sense.... Surely
      he cannot fail to realise all the impracticability, all the absurdity of
      conspiracies in Russia? In his position, in his calling ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, of course,&rsquo; Musa interrupted, with bitterness in her voice, &lsquo;he is a
      working man; and in Russia it is only permissible for noblemen to take
      part in conspiracies, ... as, for instance, in that of the fourteenth of
      December, ... that&rsquo;s what you meant to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case, what do you complain of now?&rsquo; almost broke from my lips,
      ... but I restrained myself. &lsquo;Do you consider that the result of the
      fourteenth of December was such as to encourage other such attempts?&rsquo; I
      said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musa frowned. &lsquo;It is no good talking to you about it,&rsquo; was what I read in
      her downcast face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Paramon Semyonitch very seriously compromised?&rsquo; I ventured to ask her.
      Musa made no reply.... A hungry, savage mewing was heard from the attic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musa started. &lsquo;Ah, it is a good thing Nikander Vavilitch did not see all
      this!&rsquo; she moaned almost despairingly. &lsquo;He did not see how violently in
      the night they seized his benefactor, our benefactor&mdash;maybe, the best
      and truest man in the whole world,&mdash;he did not see how they treated
      that noble man at his age, how rudely they addressed him, ... how they
      threatened him, and the threats they used to him!&mdash;only because he
      was a working man! That young officer, too, was no doubt just such an
      unprincipled, heartless wretch as I have known in my life....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Musa&rsquo;s voice broke. She was quivering all over like a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her long-suppressed indignation broke out at last; old memories stirred
      up, brought to the surface by the general tumult of her soul, showed
      themselves alive within her.... But the conviction I carried off at that
      moment was that the &lsquo;new type&rsquo; was still the same, still the same
      passionate, impulsive nature.... Only the impulses by which Musa was
      carried away were not the same as in the days of her youth. What on my
      first visit I had taken for resignation, for meekness, and what really was
      so&mdash;the subdued, lustreless glance, the cold voice, the quietness and
      simplicity&mdash;all that had significance only in relation to the past,
      to what would never return....
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was the present asserted itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to soothe Musa, tried to put our conversation on a more practical
      level. Some steps must be taken that could not be postponed; we must find
      out exactly where Baburin was; and then secure both for him and for Musa
      the means of subsistence. All this presented no inconsiderable difficulty;
      what was needed was not to find money, but work, which is, as we all know,
      a far more complicated problem....
    </p>
    <p>
      I left Musa with a perfect swarm of reflections in my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      I soon learned that Baburin was in the fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceedings began, ... dragged on. I saw Musa several times every
      week. She had several interviews with her husband. But just at the moment
      of the decision of the whole melancholy affair, I was not in Petersburg.
      Unforeseen business had obliged me to set off to the south of Russia.
      During my absence I heard that Baburin had been acquitted at the trial; it
      appeared that all that could be proved against him was, that young people
      regarding him as a person unlikely to awaken suspicion, had sometimes held
      meetings at his house, and he had been present at their meetings; he was,
      however, by administrative order sent into exile in one of the western
      provinces of Siberia. Musa went with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Paramon Semyonitch did not wish it,&rsquo; she wrote to me; &lsquo;as, according to
      his ideas, no one ought to sacrifice self for another person, and not for
      a cause; but I told him there was no question of sacrifice at all. When I
      said to him in Moscow that I would be his wife, I thought to myself&mdash;for
      ever, indissolubly! So indissoluble it must be till the end of our
      days....&rsquo;

      IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1861
    </h3>
    <p>
      Twelve more years passed by.... Every one in Russia knows, and will ever
      remember, what passed between the years 1849 and 1861. In my personal
      life, too, many changes took place, on which, however, there is no need to
      enlarge. New interests came into it, new cares.... The Baburin couple
      first fell into the background, then passed out of my mind altogether. Yet
      I kept up a correspondence with Musa&mdash;at very long intervals,
      however. Sometimes more than a year passed without any tidings of her or
      of her husband. I heard that soon after 1855 he received permission to
      return to Russia; but that he preferred to remain in the little Siberian
      town, where he had been flung by destiny, and where he had apparently made
      himself a home, and found a haven and a sphere of activity....
    </p>
    <p>
      And, lo and behold! towards the end of March in 1861, I received the
      following letter from Musa:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is so long since I have written to you, most honoured Piotr
      Petrovitch, that I do not even know whether you are still living; and if
      you are living, have you not forgotten our existence? But no matter; I
      cannot resist writing to you to-day. Everything till now has gone on with
      us in the same old way: Paramon Semyonitch and I have been always busy
      with our schools, which are gradually making good progress; besides that,
      Paramon Semyonitch was taken up with reading and correspondence and his
      usual discussions with the Old-believers, members of the clergy, and
      Polish exiles; his health has been fairly good.... So has mine. But
      yesterday! the manifesto of the 19th of February reached us! We had long
      been on the look-out for it. Rumours had reached us long before of what
      was being done among you in Petersburg, ... but yet I can&rsquo;t describe what
      it was! You know my husband well; he was not in the least changed by his
      misfortune; on the contrary, he has grown even stronger and more
      energetic, and has a will as strong as iron, but at this he could not
      restrain himself! His hands shook as he read it; then he embraced me three
      times, and three times he kissed me, tried to say something&mdash;but no!
      he could not! and ended by bursting into tears, which was very astounding
      to see, and suddenly he shouted, &ldquo;Hurrah! hurrah! God save the Tsar!&rdquo; Yes,
      Piotr Petrovitch, those were his very words! Then he went on: &ldquo;Now lettest
      Thou Thy servant depart&rdquo; ... and again: &ldquo;This is the first step, others
      are bound to follow it&rdquo;; and, just as he was, bareheaded, ran to tell the
      great news to our friends. There was a bitter frost, and even a snowstorm
      coming on. I tried to prevent him, but he would not listen to me. And when
      he came home, he was all covered with snow, his hair, his face, and his
      beard&mdash;he has a beard right down to his chest now&mdash;and the tears
      were positively frozen on his cheeks! But he was very lively and cheerful,
      and told me to uncork a bottle of home-made champagne, and he drank with
      our friends that he had brought back with him, to the health of the Tsar
      and of Russia, and all free Russians; and taking the glass, and fixing his
      eyes on the ground, he said: &ldquo;Nikander, Nikander, do you hear? There are
      no slaves in Russia any more! Rejoice in the grave, old comrade!&rdquo; And much
      more he said; to the effect that his &ldquo;expectations were fulfilled!&rdquo; He
      said, too, that now there could be no turning back; that this was in its
      way a pledge or promise.... I don&rsquo;t remember everything, but it is long
      since I have seen him so happy. And so I made up my mind to write to you,
      so that you might know how we have been rejoicing and exulting in the
      remote Siberian wilds, so that you might rejoice with us....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter I received at the end of March. At the beginning of May
      another very brief letter arrived from Musa. She informed me that her
      husband, Paramon Semyonitch Baburin, had taken cold on the very day of the
      arrival of the manifesto, and died on the 12th of April of inflammation of
      the lungs, in the 67th year of his age. She added that she intended to
      remain where his body lay at rest, and to go on with the work he had
      bequeathed her, since such was the last wish of Paramon Semyonitch, and
      that was her only law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then I have heard no more of Musa.

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      About thirty miles from our village there lived, many years ago, a distant
      cousin of my mother&rsquo;s, a retired officer of the Guards, and rather wealthy
      landowner, Alexey Sergeitch Teliegin. He lived on his estate and
      birth-place, Suhodol, did not go out anywhere, and so did not visit us;
      but I used to be sent, twice a year, to pay him my respects&mdash;at first
      with my tutor, but later on alone. Alexey Sergeitch always gave me a very
      cordial reception, and I used to stay three or four days at a time with
      him. He was an old man even when I first made his acquaintance; I was
      twelve, I remember, on my first visit, and he was then over seventy. He
      was born in the days of the Empress Elisabeth&mdash;in the last year of
      her reign. He lived alone with his wife, Malania Pavlovna; she was ten
      years younger than he. They had two daughters; but their daughters had
      been long married, and rarely visited Suhodol; they were not on the best
      of terms with their parents, and Alexey Sergeitch hardly ever mentioned
      their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see, even now, the old-fashioned house, a typical manor-house of the
      steppes. One story in height, with immense attics, it was built at the
      beginning of this century, of amazingly thick beams of pine,&mdash;such
      beams came in plenty in those days from the Zhizdrinsky pine-forests; they
      have passed out of memory now! It was very spacious, and contained a great
      number of rooms, rather low-pitched and dark, it is true; the windows in
      the walls had been made small for the sake of greater warmth. In the usual
      fashion (I ought rather to say, in what was then the usual fashion), the
      offices and house-serfs&rsquo; huts surrounded the manorial house on all sides,
      and the garden was close to it&mdash;a small garden, but containing fine
      fruit-trees, juicy apples, and pipless pears. The flat steppe of rich,
      black earth stretched for ten miles round. No lofty object for the eye;
      not a tree, nor even a belfry; somewhere, maybe, jutting up, a windmill,
      with rents in its sails; truly, well-named Suhodol, or Dry-flat! Inside
      the house the rooms were filled with ordinary, simple furniture; somewhat
      unusual was the milestone-post that stood in the window of the
      drawing-room, with the following inscription:&mdash;&lsquo;If you walk
      sixty-eight times round this drawing-room you will have gone a mile; if
      you walk eighty-seven times from the furthest corner of the parlour to the
      right-hand corner of the billiard-room, you will have gone a mile,&rsquo; and so
      on. But what most of all impressed a guest at the house for the first time
      was the immense collection of pictures hanging on the walls, for the most
      part works of the so-called Italian masters: all old-fashioned landscapes
      of a sort, or mythological and religious subjects. But all these pictures
      were very dark, and even cracked with age;&mdash;in one, all that met the
      eye was some patches of flesh-colour; in another, undulating red draperies
      on an unseen body; or an arch which seemed to be suspended in the air; or
      a dishevelled tree with blue foliage; or the bosom of a nymph with an
      immense breast, like the lid of a soup-tureen; a cut water-melon, with
      black seeds; a turban, with a feather in it, above a horse&rsquo;s head; or the
      gigantic brown leg of an apostle, suddenly thrust out, with a muscular
      calf, and toes turned upwards. In the drawing-room in the place of honour
      hung a portrait of the Empress Catherine II., full length; a copy of the
      famous portrait by Lampi&mdash;an object of the special reverence, one
      might say the adoration, of the master of the house. From the ceiling hung
      glass lustres in bronze settings, very small and very dusty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexey Sergeitch himself was a stumpy, paunchy little old man, with a
      chubby face of one uniform tint, yet pleasant, with drawn-in lips, and
      very lively little eyes under high eyebrows. He wore his scanty locks
      combed to the back of his head; it was only since 1812 that he had given
      up wearing powder. Alexey Sergeitch invariably wore a grey &lsquo;redingote,&rsquo; 
      with three capes falling over his shoulders, a striped waistcoat,
      chamois-leather breeches, and high boots of dark red morocco, with
      heart-shaped scallops and tassels at the tops; he wore a white muslin
      cravat, a jabot, lace cuffs, and two gold English &lsquo;turnip watches,&rsquo; one in
      each pocket of his waistcoat. In his right hand he usually carried an
      enamelled snuff-box full of &lsquo;Spanish&rsquo; snuff, and his left hand leaned on a
      cane with a silver-chased knob, worn smooth by long use. Alexey Sergeitch
      had a little nasal, piping voice, and an invariable smile&mdash;kindly,
      but, as it were, condescending, and not without a certain self-complacent
      dignity. His laugh, too, was kindly&mdash;a shrill little laugh that
      tinkled like glass beads. Courteous and affable he was to the last degree&mdash;in
      the old-fashioned manner of the days of Catherine&mdash;and he moved his
      hands with slow, rounded gestures, also in the old style. His legs were so
      weak that he could not walk, but ran with hurried little steps from one
      armchair to another, in which he would suddenly sit down, or rather fall
      softly, like a cushion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have said already, Alexey Sergeitch went out nowhere, and saw very
      little of his neighbours, though he liked society, for he was very fond of
      talking! It is true that he had society in plenty in his own house;
      various Nikanor Nikanoritchs, Sevastiey Sevastietchs, Fedulitchs,
      Miheitchs, all poor gentlemen in shabby cossack coats and camisoles, often
      from the master&rsquo;s wardrobe, lived under his roof, to say nothing of the
      poor gentlewomen in chintz gowns, black kerchiefs thrown over their
      shoulders, and worsted reticules in their tightly clenched fingers&mdash;all
      sorts of Avdotia Savishnas, Pelagea Mironovnas, and plain Feklushkas and
      Arinkas, who found a home in the women&rsquo;s quarters. Never less than fifteen
      persons sat down to Alexey Sergeitch&rsquo;s table.... He was such a hospitable
      man! Among all those dependants two were particularly conspicuous: a
      dwarf, nicknamed Janus, or the Double-faced, of Danish&mdash;or, as some
      maintained, Jewish&mdash;extraction, and the mad Prince L. Contrary to
      what was customary in those days, the dwarf did nothing to amuse the
      master or mistress, and was not a jester&mdash;quite the opposite; he was
      always silent, had an ill-tempered and sullen appearance, and scowled and
      gnashed his teeth directly a question was addressed to him. Alexey
      Sergeitch called him a philosopher, and positively respected him; at table
      the dishes were handed to him first, after the guests and master and
      mistress. &lsquo;God has afflicted him,&rsquo; Alexey Sergeitch used to say; &lsquo;such is
      His Divine will; but it&rsquo;s not for me to afflict him further.&rsquo; &lsquo;How is he a
      philosopher?&rsquo; I asked him once. (Janus didn&rsquo;t take to me; if I went near
      him he would fly into a rage, and mutter thickly, &lsquo;Stranger! keep off!&rsquo;)
      &lsquo;Eh, God bless me! isn&rsquo;t he a philosopher?&rsquo; answered Alexey Sergeitch.
      &lsquo;Look ye, little sir, how wisely he holds his tongue!&rsquo; &lsquo;But why is he
      double-faced?&rsquo; &lsquo;Because, little sir, he has one face on the outside&mdash;and
      so you, surface-gazers, judge him.... But the other, the real face he
      hides. And that face I know, and no one else&mdash;and I love him for it
      ... because that face is good. You, for instance, look and see nothing ...
      but I see without a word: he is blaming me for something; for he&rsquo;s a
      severe critic! And it&rsquo;s always with good reason. That, little sir, you
      can&rsquo;t understand; but you may believe an old man like me!&rsquo; The real
      history of the two-faced Janus&mdash;where he came from, and how he came
      into Alexey Sergeitch&rsquo;s hands&mdash;no one knew; but the story of Prince
      L. was well known to every one. He went, a lad of twenty, of a wealthy and
      distinguished family, to Petersburg, to serve in a regiment of the Guards.
      At the first levee the Empress Catherine noticed him, stood still before
      him, and, pointing at him with her fan, she said aloud, addressing one of
      her courtiers, who happened to be near, &lsquo;Look, Adam Vassilievitch, what a
      pretty fellow! a perfect doll!&rsquo; The poor boy&rsquo;s head was completely turned;
      when he got home he ordered his coach out, and, putting on a ribbon of St.
      Anne, proceeded to drive all over the town, as though he had reached the
      pinnacle of fortune. &lsquo;Drive over every one,&rsquo; he shouted to his coachman,
      &lsquo;who does not move out of the way!&rsquo; All this was promptly reported to the
      empress: the decree went forth that he should be declared insane, and put
      under the guardianship of two of his brothers; and they, without a
      moment&rsquo;s delay, carried him off to the country, and flung him into a stone
      cell in chains. As they wanted to get the benefit of his property, they
      did not let the poor wretch out, even when he had completely recovered his
      balance, and positively kept him locked up till he really did go out of
      his mind. But their evil doings did not prosper; Prince L. outlived his
      brothers, and, after long years of adversity, he came into the charge of
      Alexey Sergeitch, whose kinsman he was. He was a stout, completely bald
      man, with a long, thin nose and prominent blue eyes. He had quite
      forgotten how to talk&mdash;he simply uttered a sort of inarticulate
      grumbling; but he sang old-fashioned Russian ballads beautifully,
      preserving the silvery freshness of his voice to extreme old age; and,
      while he was singing, he pronounced each word clearly and distinctly. He
      had attacks at times of a sort of fury, and then he became terrible: he
      would stand in the corner, with his face to the wall, and all perspiring
      and red&mdash;red all down his bald head and down his neck&mdash;he used
      to go off into vicious chuckles, and, stamping with his feet, order some
      one&mdash;his brothers probably&mdash;to be punished. &lsquo;Beat &lsquo;em!&rsquo; he
      growled hoarsely, coughing and choking with laughter; &lsquo;flog &lsquo;em, don&rsquo;t
      spare &lsquo;em! beat, beat, beat the monsters, my oppressors! That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s
      it!&rsquo; On the day before his death he greatly alarmed and astonished Alexey
      Sergeitch. He came, pale and subdued, into his room, and, making him a low
      obeisance, first thanked him for his care and kindness, and then asked him
      to send for a priest, for death had come to him&mdash;he had seen death,
      and he must forgive every one and purify his soul. &lsquo;How did you see
      death?&rsquo; muttered Alexey Sergeitch in bewilderment at hearing connected
      speech from him for the first time. &lsquo;In what shape? with a scythe?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; 
      answered Prince L.; &lsquo;a simple old woman in a jacket, but with only one eye
      in her forehead, and that eye without an eyelid.&rsquo; And the next day Prince
      L. actually did die, duly performing everything, and taking leave of every
      one in a rational and affecting manner. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just how I shall die,&rsquo; 
      Alexey Sergeitch would sometimes observe. And, as a fact, something of the
      same sort did happen with him&mdash;but of that later.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now let us go back to our story. Of the neighbours, as I have stated
      already, Alexey Sergeitch saw little; and they did not care much for him,
      called him a queer fish, stuck up, and a scoffer, and even a &lsquo;martiniste&rsquo; 
      who recognised no authorities, though they had no clear idea of the
      meaning of this term. To a certain extent the neighbours were right:
      Alexey Sergeitch had lived in his Suhodol for almost seventy years on end,
      and had had hardly anything whatever to do with the existing authorities,
      with the police or the law-courts. &lsquo;Police-courts are for the robber, and
      discipline for the soldier,&rsquo; he used to say; &lsquo;but I, thank God, am neither
      robber nor soldier!&rsquo; Rather queer Alexey Sergeitch certainly was, but the
      soul within him was by no means a petty one. I will tell you something
      about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To tell the truth, I never knew what were his political opinions, if an
      expression so modern can be used in reference to him; but, in his own way,
      he was an aristocrat&mdash;more an aristocrat than a typical Russian
      country gentleman. More than once he expressed his regret that God had not
      given him a son and heir, &lsquo;for the honour of our name, to keep up the
      family.&rsquo; In his own room there hung on the wall the family-tree of the
      Teliegins, with many branches, and a multitude of little circles like
      apples in a golden frame. &lsquo;We Teliegins,&rsquo; he used to say, &lsquo;are an ancient
      line, from long, long ago: however many there&rsquo;ve been of us Teliegins, we
      have never hung about great men&rsquo;s ante-rooms; we&rsquo;ve never bent our backs,
      or stood about in waiting, nor picked up a living in the courts, nor run
      after decorations; we&rsquo;ve never gone trailing off to Moscow, nor intriguing
      in Petersburg; we&rsquo;ve sat at home, each in his hole, his own man on his own
      land ... home-keeping birds, sir!&mdash;I myself, though I did serve in
      the Guards&mdash;but not for long, thank you.&rsquo; Alexey Sergeitch preferred
      the old days. &lsquo;There was more freedom in those days, more decorum; on my
      honour, I assure you! but since the year eighteen hundred&rsquo; (why from that
      year, precisely, he did not explain), &lsquo;militarism, the soldiery, have got
      the upper hand. Our soldier gentlemen stuck some sort of turbans of cocks&rsquo; 
      feathers on their heads then, and turned like cocks themselves; began
      binding their necks up as stiff as could be ... they croak, and roll their
      eyes&mdash;how could they help it, indeed? The other day a police corporal
      came to me; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to you,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;honourable sir,&rdquo; ... (fancy his
      thinking to surprise me with that! ... I know I&rsquo;m honourable without his
      telling me!) &ldquo;I have business with you.&rdquo; And I said to him, &ldquo;My good sir,
      you&rsquo;d better first unfasten the hooks on your collar. Or else, God have
      mercy on us&mdash;you&rsquo;ll sneeze. Ah, what would happen to you! what would
      happen to you! You&rsquo;d break off, like a mushroom ... and I should have to
      answer for it!&rdquo; And they do drink, these military gentlemen&mdash;oh, oh,
      oh! I generally order home-made champagne to be given them, because to
      them, good wine or poor, it&rsquo;s all the same; it runs so smoothly, so
      quickly, down their throats&mdash;how can they distinguish it? And,
      another thing, they&rsquo;ve started sucking at a pap-bottle, smoking a
      tobacco-pipe. Your military gentleman thrusts his pap-bottle under his
      moustaches, between his lips, and puffs the smoke out of his nose, his
      mouth, and even his ears&mdash;and fancies himself a hero! There are my
      sons-in-law&mdash;though one of them&rsquo;s a senator, and the other some sort
      of an administrator over there&mdash;they suck the pap-bottle, and they
      reckon themselves clever fellows too!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexey Sergeitch could not endure smoking; and moreover, he could not
      endure dogs, especially little dogs. &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re a Frenchman, to be sure,
      you may well keep a lapdog: you run and you skip about here and there, and
      it runs after you with its tail up ... but what&rsquo;s the use of it to people
      like us?&rsquo; He was exceedingly neat and particular. Of the Empress Catherine
      he never spoke but with enthusiasm, and in exalted, rather bookish
      phraseology: &lsquo;Half divine she was, not human! Only look, little sir, at
      that smile,&rsquo; he would add, pointing reverentially to Lampi&rsquo;s portrait,
      &lsquo;and you will agree: half divine! I was so fortunate in my life as to be
      deemed worthy to behold that smile close, and never will it be effaced
      from my heart!&rsquo; And thereupon he would relate anecdotes of the life of
      Catherine, such as I have never happened to read or hear elsewhere. Here
      is one of them. Alexey Sergeitch did not permit the slightest allusion to
      the weaknesses of the great Tsaritsa. &lsquo;And, besides,&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;can
      one judge of her as of other people?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One day while she was sitting in her peignoir during her morning toilette,
      she commanded her hair to be combed.... And what do you think? The
      lady-in-waiting passed the comb through, and sparks of electricity simply
      showered out! Then she summoned to her presence the court physician
      Rogerson, who happened to be in waiting at the court, and said to him: &lsquo;I
      am, I know, censured for certain actions; but do you see this electricity?
      Consequently, as such is my nature and constitution, you can judge for
      yourself, as you are a doctor, that it is unjust for them to censure me,
      and they ought to comprehend me!&rsquo; The following incident remained
      indelible in Alexey Sergeitch&rsquo;s memory. He was standing one day on guard
      indoors, in the palace&mdash;he was only sixteen at the time&mdash;and
      behold the empress comes walking past him; he salutes ... &lsquo;and she,&rsquo; 
      Alexey Sergeitch would exclaim at this point with much feeling, &lsquo;smiling
      at my youth and my zeal, deigned to give me her hand to kiss and patted my
      cheek, and asked me &ldquo;who I was? where I came from? of what family?&rdquo; and
      then&rsquo; ... here the old man&rsquo;s voice usually broke ... &lsquo;then she bade me
      greet my mother in her name and thank her for having brought up her
      children so well. And whether I was on earth or in heaven, and how and
      where she deigned to vanish, whether she floated away into the heights or
      went her way into the other apartments ... to this day I do not know!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once I tried to question Alexey Sergeitch about those far-away
      times, about the people who made up the empress&rsquo;s circle.... But for the
      most part he edged off the subject. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use of talking about old
      times?&rsquo; he used to say ... &lsquo;it&rsquo;s only making one&rsquo;s self miserable,
      remembering that then one was a fine young fellow, and now one hasn&rsquo;t a
      tooth left in one&rsquo;s head. And what is there to say? They were good old
      times ... but there, enough of them! And as for those folks&mdash;you were
      asking, you troublesome boy, about the lucky ones!&mdash;haven&rsquo;t you seen
      how a bubble comes up on the water? As long as it lasts and is whole, what
      colours play upon it! Red, and blue, and yellow&mdash;a perfect rainbow or
      diamond you&rsquo;d say it was! Only it soon bursts, and there&rsquo;s no trace of it
      left. And so it was with those folks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how about Potiomkin?&rsquo; I once inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexey Sergeitch looked grave. &lsquo;Potiomkin, Grigory Alexandrovitch, was a
      statesman, a theologian, a pupil of Catherine&rsquo;s, her cherished creation,
      one must say.... But enough of that, little sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexey Sergeitch was a very devout man, and, though it was a great effort,
      he attended church regularly. Superstition was not noticeable in him; he
      laughed at omens, the evil eye, and such &lsquo;nonsense,&rsquo; but he did not like a
      hare to run across his path, and to meet a priest was not altogether
      agreeable to him. For all that, he was very respectful to clerical
      persons, and went up to receive their blessing, and even kissed the
      priest&rsquo;s hand every time, but he was not willing to enter into
      conversation with them. &lsquo;Such an extremely strong odour comes from them,&rsquo; 
      he explained: &lsquo;and I, poor sinner, am fastidious beyond reason; they&rsquo;ve
      such long hair, and all oily, and they comb it out on all sides&mdash;they
      think they show me respect by so doing, and they clear their throats so
      loudly when they talk&mdash;from shyness may be, or I dare say they want
      to show respect in that way too. And besides, they make one think of one&rsquo;s
      last hour. And, I don&rsquo;t know how it is, but I still want to go on living.
      Only, my little sir, don&rsquo;t you repeat my words; we must respect the clergy&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      only fools that don&rsquo;t respect them; and I&rsquo;m to blame to babble nonsense in
      my old age.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexey Sergeitch, like most of the noblemen of his day, had received a
      very slight education; but he had, to some extent, made good the
      deficiency himself by reading. He read none but Russian books of the end
      of last century; the more modern authors he thought insipid and deficient
      in style.... While he read, he had placed at his side on a round,
      one-legged table, a silver tankard of frothing spiced kvas of a special
      sort, which sent an agreeable fragrance all over the house. He used to put
      on the end of his nose a pair of big, round spectacles, but in latter
      years he did not so much read as gaze dreamily over the rims of his
      spectacles, lifting his eyebrows, chewing his lips, and sighing. Once I
      caught him weeping with a book on his knees, greatly, I own, to my
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had recalled these lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;O pitiful race of man!
  Peace is unknown to thee!
  Thou canst not find it save
  In the dust of the grave....
  Bitter, bitter is that sleep!
  Rest, rest in death ... but living weep!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      These lines were the composition of a certain Gormitch-Gormitsky, a
      wandering poet, to whom Alexey Sergeitch had given a home in his house, as
      he struck him as a man of delicate feeling and even of subtlety; he wore
      slippers adorned with ribbons, spoke with a broad accent, and frequently
      sighed, turning his eyes to heaven; in addition to all these
      qualifications, Gormitch-Gormitsky spoke French decently, having been
      educated in a Jesuit college, while Alexey Sergeitch only &lsquo;followed
      conversation.&rsquo; But having once got terribly drunk at the tavern, that same
      subtle Gormitsky showed a turbulence beyond all bounds; he gave a fearful
      thrashing to Alexey Sergeitch&rsquo;s valet, the man cook, two laundry-maids who
      chanced to get in his way, and a carpenter from another village, and he
      broke several panes in the windows, screaming furiously all the while:
      &lsquo;There, I&rsquo;ll show them, these Russian loafers, rough-hewn billy-goats!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the strength the frail-looking creature put forth! It was hard work
      for eight men to master him! For this violent proceeding Alexey Sergeitch
      ordered the poet to be turned out of the house, after being put, as a
      preliminary measure, in the snow&mdash;it was winter-time&mdash;to sober
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Alexey Sergeitch used to say, &lsquo;my day is over; I was a spirited
      steed, but I&rsquo;ve run my last race now. Then, I used to keep poets at my
      expense, and I used to buy pictures and books of the Jews, geese of the
      best breeds, and pouter-pigeons of pure blood.... I used to go in for
      everything! Though dogs I never did care for keeping, because it goes with
      drinking, foulness, and buffoonery! I was a young man of spirit, not to be
      outdone. That there should be anything of Teliegin&rsquo;s and not first-rate
      ... why, it was not to be thought of! And I had a splendid stud of horses.
      And my horses came&mdash;from what stock do you think, young sir? Why,
      from none other than the celebrated stables of the Tsar, Ivan Alexeitch,
      brother of Peter the Great ... it&rsquo;s the truth I&rsquo;m telling you! All
      fawn-coloured stallions, sleek&mdash;their manes to their knees, their
      tails to their hoofs.... Lions! And all that was&mdash;and is buried in
      the past. Vanity of vanities&mdash;and every kind of vanity! But still&mdash;why
      regret it? Every man has his limits set him. There&rsquo;s no flying above the
      sky, no living in the water, no getting away from the earth.... We&rsquo;ll live
      a bit longer, anyway!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the old man would smile again and sniff his Spanish snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasants liked him; he was, in their words, a kind master, not easily
      angered. Only they, too, repeated that he was a worn-out steed. In former
      days Alexey Sergeitch used to go into everything himself&mdash;he used to
      drive out to the fields, and to the mill, and to the dairy, and peep into
      the granaries and the peasants&rsquo; huts; every one knew his racing droshky,
      upholstered in crimson plush, and drawn by a tall mare, with a broad white
      star all over her forehead, called &lsquo;Beacon,&rsquo; of the same famous breed.
      Alexey Sergeitch used to drive her himself, the ends of the reins crushed
      up in his fists. But when his seventieth year came, the old man let
      everything go, and handed over the management of the estate to the bailiff
      Antip, of whom he was secretly afraid, and whom he called Micromegas (a
      reminiscence of Voltaire!), or simply, plunderer. &lsquo;Well, plunderer, what
      have you to say? Have you stacked a great deal in the barn?&rsquo; he would ask
      with a smile, looking straight into the plunderer&rsquo;s eyes. &lsquo;All, by your
      good favour, please your honour,&rsquo; Antip would respond cheerfully.
      &lsquo;Favour&rsquo;s all very well, only you mind what I say, Micromegas! don&rsquo;t you
      dare touch the peasants, my subjects, out of my sight! If they come to
      complain ... I&rsquo;ve a cane, you see, not far off!&rsquo; &lsquo;Your cane, your honour,
      Alexey Sergeitch, I always keep well in mind,&rsquo; Antip Micromegas would
      respond, stroking his beard. &lsquo;All right, don&rsquo;t forget it.&rsquo; And the master
      and the bailiff would laugh in each other&rsquo;s faces. With the servants, and
      with the serfs in general, his &lsquo;subjects&rsquo; (Alexey Sergeitch liked that
      word) he was gentle in his behaviour. &lsquo;Because, think a little, nephew;
      nothing of their own, but the cross on their neck&mdash;and that copper&mdash;and
      daren&rsquo;t hanker after other people&rsquo;s goods ... how can one expect sense of
      them?&rsquo; It is needless to state that of the so-called &lsquo;serf question&rsquo; no
      one even dreamed in those days; it could not disturb the peace of mind of
      Alexey Sergeitch: he was quite happy in the possession of his &lsquo;subjects&rsquo;;
      but he was severe in his censure of bad masters, and used to call them the
      enemies of their order. He divided the nobles generally into three
      classes: the prudent, &lsquo;of whom there are too few&rsquo;; the prodigal, &lsquo;of whom
      there are quite enough&rsquo;; and the senseless, &lsquo;of whom there are shoals and
      shoals.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if any one of them is harsh and oppressive with his subjects&rsquo;&mdash;he
      would say&mdash;&lsquo;then he sins against God, and is guilty before men!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the house-serfs had an easy life of it with the old man; the
      &lsquo;subjects out of sight&rsquo; no doubt fared worse, in spite of the cane with
      which he threatened Micromegas. And what a lot there were of them, those
      house-serfs, in his house! And for the most part sinewy, hairy, grumbling
      old fellows, with stooping shoulders, in long-skirted nankeen coats,
      belted round the waist, with a strong, sour smell always clinging to them.
      And on the women&rsquo;s side, one could hear nothing but the patter of bare
      feet, the swish of petticoats. The chief valet was called Irinarh, and
      Alexey Sergeitch always called him in a long-drawn-out call:
      &lsquo;I-ri-na-a-arh!&rsquo; The others he called: &lsquo;Boy! Lad! Whoever&rsquo;s there of the
      men!&rsquo; Bells he could not endure: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not an eating-house, God forbid!&rsquo; 
      And what used to surprise me was that whatever time Alexey Sergeitch
      called his valet, he always promptly made his appearance, as though he had
      sprung out of the earth, and with a scrape of his heels, his hands behind
      his back, would stand before his master, a surly, as it were angry, but
      devoted servant!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexey Sergeitch was liberal beyond his means; but he did not like to be
      called &lsquo;benefactor.&rsquo; &lsquo;Benefactor to you, indeed, sir! ... I&rsquo;m doing myself
      a benefit, and not you, sir!&rsquo; (when he was angry or indignant, he always
      addressed people with greater formality). &lsquo;Give to a beggar once,&rsquo; he used
      to say, &lsquo;and give him twice, and three times.... And&mdash;if he should
      come a fourth time, give to him still&mdash;only then you might say too:
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time, my good man, you found work for something else, not only for
      your mouth.&rdquo;&rsquo; &lsquo;But, uncle,&rsquo; one asked, sometimes, &lsquo;suppose even after that
      the beggar came again, a fifth time?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, well, give again the fifth
      time.&rsquo; He used to have the sick, who came to him for aid, treated at his
      expense, though he had no faith in doctors himself, and never sent for
      them. &lsquo;My mother,&rsquo; he declared, &lsquo;used to cure illnesses of all sorts with
      oil and salt&mdash;she gave it internally, and rubbed it on too&mdash;it
      always answered splendidly. And who was my mother? She was born in the
      days of Peter the Great&mdash;only fancy that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexey Sergeitch was a Russian in everything; he liked none but Russian
      dishes, he was fond of Russian songs, but the harmonica&mdash;a
      &lsquo;manufactured contrivance&rsquo;&mdash;he hated; he liked looking at the
      serf-girls&rsquo; dances and the peasant-women&rsquo;s jigs; in his youth, I was told,
      he had been an enthusiastic singer and a dashing dancer; he liked steaming
      himself in the bath, and steamed himself so vigorously that Irinarh, who,
      serving him as bathman, used to beat him with a bundle of birch-twigs
      steeped in beer, to rub him with a handful of tow, and then with a woollen
      cloth&mdash;the truly devoted Irinarh used to say every time, as he crept
      off his shelf red as a &lsquo;new copper image&rsquo;: &lsquo;Well, this time I, the servant
      of God, Irinarh Tolobiev, have come out alive. How will it be next time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Alexey Sergeitch spoke excellent Russian, a little old-fashioned, but
      choice and pure as spring water, continually interspersing his remarks
      with favourite expressions: &lsquo;&rsquo;Pon my honour, please God, howsoever that
      may be, sir, and young sir....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But enough of him. Let us talk a little about Alexey Sergeitch&rsquo;s wife,
      Malania Pavlovna. Malania Pavlovna was born at Moscow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been famous as the greatest beauty in Moscow&mdash;<i>la Vénus de
      Moscou</i>. I knew her as a thin old woman with delicate but insignificant
      features, with crooked teeth, like a hare&rsquo;s, in a tiny little mouth, with
      a multitude of finely crimped little yellow curls on her forehead, and
      painted eyebrows. She invariably wore a pyramidal cap with pink ribbons, a
      high ruff round her neck, a short white dress, and prunella slippers with
      red heels; and over her dress she wore a jacket of blue satin, with a
      sleeve hanging loose from her right shoulder. This was precisely the
      costume in which she was arrayed on St. Peter&rsquo;s Day in the year 1789! On
      that day she went, being still a girl, with her relations to the Hodinskoe
      field to see the famous boxing-match arranged by Orlov. &lsquo;And Count Alexey
      Grigorievitch&rsquo; (oh, how often I used to hear this story!) &lsquo;noticing me,
      approached, bowed very low, taking his hat in both hands, and said:
      &ldquo;Peerless beauty,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why have you hung that sleeve from your
      shoulder? Do you, too, wish to try a tussle with me? ... By all means;
      only I will tell you beforehand you have vanquished me&mdash;I give in!
      And I am your captive.&rdquo; And every one was looking at us and wondering.&rsquo; 
      And that very costume she had worn continually ever since. &lsquo;Only I didn&rsquo;t
      wear a cap, but a hat <i>à la bergère de Trianon</i>; and though I was
      powdered, yet my hair shone through it, positively shone through it like
      gold!&rsquo; Malania Pavlovna was foolish to the point of &lsquo;holy innocence,&rsquo; as
      it is called; she chattered quite at random, as though she were hardly
      aware herself of what dropped from her lips&mdash;and mostly about Orlov.
      Orlov had become, one might say, the principal interest of her life. She
      usually walked ... or rather swam, into the room with a rhythmic movement
      of the head, like a peacock, stood still in the middle, with one foot
      strangely turned out, and two fingers holding the tip of the loose sleeve
      (I suppose this pose, too, must once have charmed Orlov); she would glance
      about her with haughty nonchalance, as befits a beauty&mdash;and with a
      positive sniff, and a murmur of &lsquo;What next!&rsquo; as though some importunate
      gallant were besieging her with compliments, she would go out again,
      tapping her heels and shrugging her shoulders. She used, too, to take
      Spanish snuff out of a tiny bonbonnière, picking it up with a tiny golden
      spoon; and from time to time, especially when any one unknown to her was
      present, she would hold up&mdash;not to her eyes, she had splendid sight,
      but to her nose&mdash;a double eyeglass in the shape of a half-moon, with
      a coquettish turn of her little white hand, one finger held out separate
      from the rest. How often has Malania Pavlovna described to me her wedding
      in the church of the Ascension, in Arbaty&mdash;such a fine church!&mdash;and
      how all Moscow was there ... &lsquo;and the crush there was!&mdash;awful!
      Carriages with teams, golden coaches, outriders ... one outrider of Count
      Zavadovsky got run over! and we were married by the archbishop himself&mdash;and
      what a sermon he gave us! every one was crying&mdash;wherever I looked I
      saw tears ... and the governor-general&rsquo;s horses were tawny, like tigers.
      And the flowers, the flowers that were brought! ... Simply loads of
      flowers!&rsquo; And how on that day a foreigner, a wealthy, tremendously wealthy
      person, had shot himself from love&mdash;and how Orlov too had been
      there.... And going up to Alexey Sergeitch, he had congratulated him and
      called him a lucky man.... &lsquo;A lucky man you are, you silly fellow!&rsquo; said
      he. And how in answer to these words Alexey Sergeitch had made a wonderful
      bow, and had swept the floor from left to right with the plumes of his
      hat, as if he would say: &lsquo;Your Excellency, there is a line now between you
      and my spouse, which you will not overstep!&rsquo; And Orlov, Alexey
      Grigorievitch understood at once, and commended him. &lsquo;Oh! that was a man!
      such a man!&rsquo; And how, &lsquo;One day, Alexis and I were at his house at a ball&mdash;I
      was married then&mdash;and he had the most marvellous diamond buttons! And
      I could not resist it, I admired them. &ldquo;What marvellous diamonds you have,
      Count!&rdquo; said I. And he, taking up a knife from the table, at once cut off
      a button and presented it to me and said: &ldquo;In your eyes, my charmer, the
      diamonds are a hundred times brighter; stand before the looking-glass and
      compare them.&rdquo; And I stood so, and he stood beside me. &ldquo;Well, who&rsquo;s
      right?&rdquo; said he, while he simply rolled his eyes, looking me up and down.
      And Alexey Sergeitch was very much put out about it, but I said to him:
      &ldquo;Alexis,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t you be put out; you ought to know me
      better!&rdquo; And he answered me: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb yourself, Melanie!&rdquo; And these
      very diamonds are now round my medallion of Alexey Grigorievitch&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      seen it, I dare say, my dear;&mdash;I wear it on feast-days on a St.
      George ribbon, because he was a brave hero, a knight of St. George: he
      burned the Turks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that, Malania Pavlovna was a very kind-hearted woman; she was
      easily pleased. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s not one to snarl, nor to sneer,&rsquo; the maids used to
      say of her. Malania Pavlovna was passionately fond of sweet things&mdash;and
      a special old woman who looked after nothing but the jam, and so was
      called the jam-maid, would bring her, ten times a day, a china dish with
      rose-leaves crystallised in sugar, or barberries in honey, or sherbet of
      bananas. Malania Pavlovna was afraid of solitude&mdash;dreadful thoughts
      are apt to come over one, she would say&mdash;and was almost always
      surrounded by companions, whom she would urgently implore: &lsquo;Talk, talk!
      why do you sit like that, simply keeping your seats warm!&rsquo; and they would
      begin twittering like canaries. She was no less devout than Alexey
      Sergeitch, and was very fond of praying; but as, in her own words, she had
      never learned to repeat prayers well, she kept for the purpose a poor
      deacon&rsquo;s widow who prayed with such relish! Never stumbled over a word in
      her life! And this deacon&rsquo;s widow certainly could utter the words of
      prayer in a sort of unbroken flow, not interrupting the stream to breathe
      out or draw breath in, while Malania Pavlovna listened and was much moved.
      She had another widow in attendance on her&mdash;it was her duty to tell
      her stories in the night. &lsquo;But only the old ones,&rsquo; Malania Pavlovna would
      beg&mdash;&lsquo;those I know already; the new ones are all so far-fetched.&rsquo; 
      Malania Pavlovna was flighty in the extreme, and at times she was fanciful
      too; some ridiculous notion would suddenly come into her head. She did not
      like the dwarf, Janus, for instance; she was always fancying he would
      suddenly get up and shout, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know who I am? The prince of the
      Buriats. Mind, you are to obey me!&rsquo; Or else that he would set fire to the
      house in a fit of spleen. Malania Pavlovna was as liberal as Alexey
      Sergeitch; but she never gave money&mdash;she did not like to soil her
      hands&mdash;but kerchiefs, bracelets, dresses, ribbons; or she would send
      pies from the table, or a piece of roast meat, or a bottle of wine. She
      liked feasting the peasant-women, too, on holidays; they would dance, and
      she would tap with her heels and throw herself into attitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexey Sergeitch was well aware that his wife was a fool; but almost from
      the first year of his marriage he had schooled himself to keep up the
      fiction that she was very witty and fond of saying cutting things.
      Sometimes when her chatter began to get beyond all bounds, he would
      threaten her with his finger, and say as he did so: &lsquo;Ah, the tongue, the
      tongue! what it will have to answer for in the other world! It will be
      pierced with a redhot pin!&rsquo;

    <p>
      Malania Pavlovna was not offended, however, at this; on the contrary, she
      seemed to feel flattered at hearing a reproof of that sort, as though she
      would say, &lsquo;Well! is it my fault if I&rsquo;m naturally witty?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Malania Pavlovna adored her husband, and had been all her life an
      exemplarily faithful wife; but there had been a romance even in her life&mdash;a
      young cousin, an hussar, killed, as she supposed, in a duel on her
      account; but, according to more trustworthy reports, killed by a blow on
      the head from a billiard-cue in a tavern brawl. A water-colour portrait of
      this object of her affections was kept by her in a secret drawer. Malania
      Pavlovna always blushed up to her ears when she mentioned Kapiton&mdash;such
      was the name of the young hero&mdash;and Alexey Sergeitch would designedly
      scowl, shake his finger at his wife again, and say: &lsquo;No trusting a horse
      in the field nor a woman in the house. Don&rsquo;t talk to me of Kapiton, he&rsquo;s
      Cupidon!&rsquo; Then Malania Pavlovna would be all of a flutter and say:
      &lsquo;Alexis, Alexis, it&rsquo;s too bad of you! In your young days you flirted, I&rsquo;ve
      no doubt, with all sorts of misses and madams&mdash;and so now you
      imagine....&rsquo; &lsquo;Come, that&rsquo;s enough, that&rsquo;s enough, my dear Malania,&rsquo; Alexey
      Sergeitch interrupted with a smile. &lsquo;Your gown is white&mdash;but whiter
      still your soul!&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, Alexis, it is whiter!&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah, what a tongue, what a
      tongue!&rsquo; Alexis would repeat, patting her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      To speak of &lsquo;views&rsquo; in the case of Malania Pavlovna would be even more
      inappropriate than in the case of Alexey Sergeitch; yet I once chanced to
      witness a strange manifestation of my aunt&rsquo;s secret feelings. In the
      course of conversation I once somehow mentioned the famous chief of
      police, Sheshkovsky; Malania Pavlovna turned suddenly livid&mdash;positively
      livid, green, in spite of her rouge and paint&mdash;and in a thick and
      perfectly unaffected voice (a very rare thing with her&mdash;she usually
      minced a little, intoned, and lisped) she said: &lsquo;Oh, what a name to utter!
      And towards nightfall, too! Don&rsquo;t utter that name!&rsquo; I was astonished; what
      kind of significance could his name have for such a harmless and
      inoffensive creature, incapable&mdash;not merely of doing&mdash;even of
      thinking of anything not permissible? Anything but cheerful reflections
      were aroused in me by this terror, manifesting itself after almost half a
      century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexey Sergeitch died in his eighty-eighth year&mdash;in the year 1848,
      which apparently disturbed even him. His death, too, was rather strange.
      He had felt well the same morning, though by that time he never left his
      easy-chair. And all of a sudden he called his wife: &lsquo;Malania, my dear,
      come here.&rsquo; &lsquo;What is it, Alexis?&rsquo; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s time for me to die, my dear,
      that&rsquo;s what it is.&rsquo; &lsquo;Mercy on you, Alexey Sergeitch! What for?&rsquo; &lsquo;Because,
      first of all, one must know when to take leave; and, besides, I was
      looking the other day at my feet.... Look at my feet ... they are not mine
      ... say what you like ... look at my hands, look at my stomach ... that
      stomach&rsquo;s not mine&mdash;so really I&rsquo;m using up another man&rsquo;s life. Send
      for the priest; and meanwhile, put me to bed&mdash;from which I shall not
      get up again.&rsquo; Malania Pavlovna was terribly upset; however, she put the
      old man to bed and sent for the priest. Alexey Sergeitch confessed, took
      the sacrament, said good-bye to his household, and fell asleep. Malania
      Pavlovna was sitting by his bedside. &lsquo;Alexis!&rsquo; she cried suddenly, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
      frighten me, don&rsquo;t shut your eyes! Are you in pain?&rsquo; The old man looked at
      his wife: &lsquo;No, no pain ... but it&rsquo;s difficult ... difficult to breathe.&rsquo; 
      Then after a brief silence: &lsquo;Malania,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;so life has slipped by&mdash;and
      do you remember when we were married ... what a couple we were?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, we
      were, my handsome, charming Alexis!&rsquo; The old man was silent again.
      &lsquo;Malania, my dear, shall we meet again in the next world?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will pray
      God for it, Alexis,&rsquo; and the old woman burst into tears. &lsquo;Come, don&rsquo;t cry,
      silly; maybe the Lord God will make us young again then&mdash;and again we
      shall be a fine pair!&rsquo; &lsquo;He will make us young, Alexis!&rsquo; &lsquo;With the Lord all
      things are possible,&rsquo; observed Alexey Sergeitch. &lsquo;He worketh great
      marvels!&mdash;maybe He will make you sensible.... There, my love, I was
      joking; come, let me kiss your hand.&rsquo; &lsquo;And I yours.&rsquo; And the two old
      people kissed each other&rsquo;s hands simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexey Sergeitch began to grow quieter and to sink into forgetfulness.
      Malania Pavlovna watched him tenderly, brushing the tears off her
      eyelashes with her finger-tips. For two hours she continued sitting there.
      &lsquo;Is he asleep?&rsquo; the old woman with the talent for praying inquired in a
      whisper, peeping in behind Irinarh, who, immovable as a post, stood in the
      doorway, gazing intently at his expiring master. &lsquo;He is asleep,&rsquo; answered
      Malania Pavlovna also in a whisper. And suddenly Alexey Sergeitch opened
      his eyes. &lsquo;My faithful companion,&rsquo; he faltered, &lsquo;my honoured wife, I would
      bow down at your little feet for all your love and faithfulness&mdash;but
      how to get up? Let me sign you with the cross.&rsquo; Malania Pavlovna moved
      closer, bent down.... But the hand he had raised fell back powerless on
      the quilt, and a few moments later Alexey Sergeitch was no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughters arrived only on the day of the funeral with their husbands;
      they had no children either of them. Alexey Sergeitch showed them no
      animosity in his will, though he never even mentioned them on his
      death-bed. &lsquo;My heart has grown hard to them,&rsquo; he once said to me. Knowing
      his kindly nature, I was surprised at his words. It is hard to judge
      between parents and children. &lsquo;A great ravine starts from a little rift,&rsquo; 
      Alexey Sergeitch said to me once in this connection: &lsquo;a wound a yard wide
      may heal; but once cut off even a finger nail, it will not grow again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I fancy the daughters were ashamed of their eccentric old parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month later and Malania Pavlovna too passed away. From the very day of
      Alexey Sergeitch&rsquo;s death she had hardly risen from her bed, and had not
      put on her usual attire; but they buried her in the blue jacket, and with
      Orlov&rsquo;s medallion on her shoulder, only without the diamonds. Those her
      daughters divided, on the pretext that the diamonds should be used in the
      setting of some holy pictures; in reality, they used them to adorn their
      own persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I can see my old friends as though they were alive and before my
      eyes, and pleasant is the memory I preserve of them. And yet on my very
      last visit to them (I was a student by then) an incident occurred which
      jarred upon the impression of patriarchal harmony always produced in me by
      the Teliegin household.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the house-serfs there was one Ivan, called &lsquo;Suhys&rsquo; Ivan,&rsquo; a coachman
      or coach-boy, as they called him on account of his small size, in spite of
      his being no longer young. He was a tiny little man, brisk, snub-nosed,
      curly-headed, with an everlastingly smiling, childish face, and little
      eyes, like a mouse&rsquo;s. He was a great joker, a most comic fellow; he was
      great at all sorts of tricks&mdash;he used to fly kites, let off fireworks
      and rockets, to play all sorts of games, gallop standing up on the horse&rsquo;s
      back, fly higher than all the rest in the swing, and could even make
      Chinese shadows. No one could amuse children better; and he would gladly
      spend the whole day looking after them. When he started laughing, the
      whole house would seem to liven up; they would answer him&mdash;one would
      say one thing, one another, but he always made them all merry.... And even
      if they abused him, they could not but laugh. Ivan danced marvellously,
      especially the so-called &lsquo;fish dance.&rsquo; When the chorus struck up a dance
      tune, the fellow would come into the middle of the ring, and then there
      would begin such a turning and skipping and stamping, and then he would
      fall flat on the ground, and imitate the movement of a fish brought out of
      the water on to dry land; such turning and wriggling, the heels positively
      clapped up to the head; and then he would get up and shriek&mdash;the
      earth seemed simply quivering under him. At times Alexey Sergeitch, who
      was, as I have said already, exceedingly fond of watching dancing, could
      not resist shouting, &lsquo;Little Vania, here! coach-boy! Dance us the fish,
      smartly now&rsquo;; and a minute later he would whisper enthusiastically: &lsquo;Ah,
      what a fellow it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, on my last visit, this Ivan Suhih came into my room, and, without
      saying a word, fell on his knees. &lsquo;Ivan, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; &lsquo;Save me,
      sir.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, what is it?&rsquo; And thereupon Ivan told me his trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was exchanged, twenty years ago, by &lsquo;the Suhy family for a serf of the
      Teliegins&rsquo;;&mdash;simply exchanged without any kind of formality or
      written deed: the man given in exchange for him had died, but the Suhys
      had forgotten about Ivan, and he had stayed on in Alexey Sergeitch&rsquo;s house
      as his own serf; only his nickname had served to recall his origin. But
      now his former masters were dead; the estate had passed into other hands;
      and the new owner, who was reported to be a cruel and oppressive man,
      having learned that one of his serfs was detained without cause or reason
      at Alexey Sergeitch&rsquo;s, began to demand him back; in case of refusal he
      threatened legal proceedings, and the threat was not an empty one, as he
      was himself of the rank of privy councillor, and had great weight in the
      province. Ivan had rushed in terror to Alexey Sergeitch. The old man was
      sorry for his dancer, and he offered the privy councillor to buy Ivan for
      a considerable sum. But the privy councillor would not hear of it; he was
      a Little Russian, and obstinate as the devil. The poor fellow would have
      to be given up. &lsquo;I have spent my life here, and I&rsquo;m at home here; I have
      served here, here I have eaten my bread, and here I want to die,&rsquo; Ivan
      said to me&mdash;and there was no smile on his face now; on the contrary,
      it looked turned to stone.... &lsquo;And now I am to go to this wretch.... Am I
      a dog to be flung from one kennel to another with a noose round my neck?
      ... to be told: &ldquo;There, get along with you!&rdquo; Save me, master; beg your
      uncle, remember how I always amused you.... Or else there&rsquo;ll be harm come
      of it; it won&rsquo;t end without sin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of sin, Ivan?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall kill that gentleman. I shall simply go and say to him, &ldquo;Master,
      let me go back; or else, mind, be careful of yourself.... I shall kill
      you.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      If a siskin or a chaffinch could have spoken, and had begun declaring that
      it would peck another bird to death, it would not have reduced me to
      greater amazement than did Ivan at that moment. What! Suhys&rsquo; Vania, that
      dancing, jesting, comic fellow, the favourite playfellow of children, and
      a child himself, that kindest-hearted of creatures, a murderer! What
      ridiculous nonsense! Not for an instant did I believe him; what astonished
      me to such a degree was that he was capable of saying such a thing. Anyway
      I appealed to Alexey Sergeitch. I did not repeat what Ivan had said to me,
      but began asking him whether something couldn&rsquo;t be done. &lsquo;My young sir,&rsquo; 
      the old man answered, &lsquo;I should be only too happy&mdash;but what&rsquo;s to be
      done? I offered this Little Russian an immense compensation&mdash;I
      offered him three hundred roubles, &lsquo;pon my honour, I tell you! but he&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      no moving him! what&rsquo;s one to do? The transaction was not legal, it was
      done on trust, in the old-fashioned way ... and now see what mischief&rsquo;s
      come of it! This Little Russian fellow, you see, will take Ivan by force,
      do what we will: his arm is powerful, the governor eats cabbage-soup at
      his table; he&rsquo;ll be sending along soldiers. And I&rsquo;m afraid of those
      soldiers! In old days, to be sure, I would have stood up for Ivan, come
      what might; but now, look at me, what a feeble creature I have grown! How
      can I make a fight for it?&rsquo; It was true; on my last visit I found Alexey
      Sergeitch greatly aged; even the centres of his eyes had that milky colour
      that babies&rsquo; eyes have, and his lips wore not his old conscious smile, but
      that unnatural, mawkish, unconscious grin, which never, even in sleep,
      leaves the faces of very decrepit old people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told Ivan of Alexey Sergeitch&rsquo;s decision. He stood still, was silent for
      a little, shook his head. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he at last, &lsquo;what is to be there&rsquo;s
      no escaping. Only my mind&rsquo;s made up. There&rsquo;s nothing left, then, but to
      play the fool to the end. Something for drink, please!&rsquo; I gave him
      something; he drank himself drunk, and that day danced the &lsquo;fish dance&rsquo; so
      that the serf-girls and peasant-women positively shrieked with delight&mdash;he
      surpassed himself in his antics so wonderfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day I went home, and three months later, in Petersburg, I heard that
      Ivan had kept his word. He had been sent to his new master; his master had
      called him into his room, and explained to him that he would be made
      coachman, that a team of three ponies would be put in his charge, and that
      he would be severely dealt with if he did not look after them well, and
      were not punctual in discharging his duties generally. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not fond of
      joking.&rsquo; Ivan heard the master out, first bowed down to his feet, and then
      announced it was as his honour pleased, but he could not be his servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me off for a yearly quit-money, your honour,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;or send me
      for a soldier; or else there&rsquo;ll be mischief come of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The master flew into a rage. &lsquo;Ah, what a fellow you are! How dare you
      speak to me like that? In the first place, I&rsquo;m to be called your
      excellency, and not your honour; and, secondly, you&rsquo;re beyond the age, and
      not of a size to be sent for a soldier; and, lastly, what mischief do you
      threaten me with? Do you mean to set the house on fire, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, your excellency, not the house on fire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Murder me, then, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan was silent. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not your servant,&rsquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh well, I&rsquo;ll show you,&rsquo; roared the master, &lsquo;whether you &lsquo;re my servant
      or not.&rsquo; And he had Ivan cruelly punished, but yet had the three ponies
      put into his charge, and made him coachman in the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan apparently submitted; he began driving about as coachman. As he drove
      well, he soon gained favour with the master, especially as Ivan was very
      quiet and steady in his behaviour, and the ponies improved so much in his
      hands; he turned them out as sound and sleek as cucumbers&mdash;it was
      quite a sight to see. The master took to driving out with him oftener than
      with the other coachmen. Sometimes he would ask him, &lsquo;I say, Ivan, do you
      remember how badly we got on when we met? You&rsquo;ve got over all that
      nonsense, eh?&rsquo; But Ivan never made any response to such remarks. So one
      day the master was driving with Ivan to the town in his three-horse sledge
      with bells and a highback covered with carpet. The horses began to walk up
      the hill, and Ivan got off the box-seat and went behind the back of the
      sledge as though he had dropped something. It was a sharp frost; the
      master sat wrapped up, with a beaver cap pulled down on to his ears. Then
      Ivan took an axe from under his skirt, came up to the master from behind,
      knocked off his cap, and saying, &lsquo;I warned you, Piotr Petrovitch&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      yourself to blame now!&rsquo; he struck off his head at one blow. Then he
      stopped the ponies, put the cap on his dead master, and, getting on the
      box-seat again, drove him to the town, straight to the courts of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the Suhinsky general for you, dead; I have killed him. As I told
      him, so I did to him. Put me in fetters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They took Ivan, tried him, sentenced him to the knout, and then to hard
      labour. The light-hearted, bird-like dancer was sent to the mines, and
      there passed out of sight for ever....
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; one can but repeat, in another sense, Alexey Sergeitch&rsquo;s words: &lsquo;They
      were good old times ... but enough of them!&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Reader, do you know those little homesteads of country gentlefolks, which
      were plentiful in our Great Russian Oukraïne twenty-five or thirty years
      ago? Now one rarely comes across them, and in another ten years the last
      of them will, I suppose, have disappeared for ever. The running pond
      overgrown with reeds and rushes, the favourite haunt of fussy ducks, among
      whom one may now and then come across a wary &lsquo;teal&rsquo;; beyond the pond a
      garden with avenues of lime-trees, the chief beauty and glory of our
      black-earth plains, with smothered rows of &lsquo;Spanish&rsquo; strawberries, with
      dense thickets of gooseberries, currants, and raspberries, in the midst of
      which, in the languid hour of the stagnant noonday heat, one would be sure
      to catch glimpses of a serf-girl&rsquo;s striped kerchief, and to hear the
      shrill ring of her voice. Close by would be a summer-house standing on
      four legs, a conservatory, a neglected kitchen garden, with flocks of
      sparrows hung on stakes, and a cat curled up on the tumble-down well; a
      little further, leafy apple-trees in the high grass, which is green below
      and grey above, straggling cherry-trees, pear-trees, on which there is
      never any fruit; then flower-beds, poppies, peonies, pansies, milkwort,
      &lsquo;maids in green,&rsquo; bushes of Tartar honeysuckle, wild jasmine, lilac and
      acacia, with the continual hum of bees and wasps among their thick,
      fragrant, sticky branches. At last comes the manor-house, a one-storied
      building on a brick foundation, with greenish window-panes in narrow
      frames, a sloping, once painted roof, a little balcony from which the
      vases of the balustrade are always jutting out, a crooked gable, and a
      husky old dog in the recess under the steps at the door. Behind the house
      a wide yard with nettles, wormwood, and burdocks in the corners,
      outbuildings with doors that stick, doves and rooks on the thatched roofs,
      a little storehouse with a rusty weathercock, two or three birch-trees
      with rooks&rsquo; nests in their bare top branches, and beyond&mdash;the road
      with cushions of soft dust in the ruts and a field and the long hurdles of
      the hemp patches, and the grey little huts of the village, and the cackle
      of geese in the far-away rich meadows.... Is all this familiar to you,
      reader? In the house itself everything is a little awry, a little rickety&mdash;but
      no matter. It stands firm and keeps warm; the stoves are like elephants,
      the furniture is of all sorts, home-made. Little paths of white footmarks
      run from the doors over the painted floors. In the hall siskins and larks
      in tiny cages; in the corner of the dining-room an immense English clock
      in the form of a tower, with the inscription, &lsquo;Strike&mdash;silent&rsquo;; in
      the drawing-room portraits of the family, painted in oils, with an
      expression of ill-tempered alarm on the brick-coloured faces, and
      sometimes too an old warped picture of flowers and fruit or a mythological
      subject. Everywhere there is the smell of kvas, of apples, of linseed-oil
      and of leather. Flies buzz and hum about the ceiling and the windows. A
      daring cockroach suddenly shows his countenance from behind the
      looking-glass frame.... No matter, one can live here&mdash;and live very
      well too.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just such a homestead it was my lot to visit thirty years ago ... it was
      in days long past, as you perceive. The little estate in which this house
      stood belonged to a friend of mine at the university; it had only recently
      come to him on the death of a bachelor cousin, and he was not living in it
      himself.... But at no great distance from it there were wide tracts of
      steppe bog, in which at the time of summer migration, when they are on the
      wing, there are great numbers of snipe; my friend and I, both enthusiastic
      sportsmen, agreed therefore to go on St. Peter&rsquo;s day, he from Moscow, I
      from my own village, to his little house. My friend lingered in Moscow,
      and was two days late; I did not care to start shooting without him. I was
      received by an old servant, Narkiz Semyonov, who had had notice of my
      coming. This old servant was not in the least like &lsquo;Savelitch&rsquo; or &lsquo;Caleb&rsquo;;
      my friend used to call him in joke &lsquo;Marquis.&rsquo; There was something of
      conceit, even of affectation, about him; he looked down on us young men
      with a certain dignity, but cherished no particularly respectful
      sentiments for other landowners either; of his old master he spoke
      slightingly, while his own class he simply scorned for their ignorance. He
      could read and write, expressed himself correctly and with judgment, and
      did not drink. He seldom went to church, and so was looked upon as a
      dissenter. In appearance he was thin and tall, had a long and good-looking
      face, a sharp nose, and overhanging eyebrows, which he was continually
      either knitting or lifting; he wore a neat, roomy coat, and boots to his
      knees with heart-shaped scallops at the tops.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the day of my arrival, Narkiz, having given me lunch and cleared the
      table, stood in the doorway, looked intently at me, and with some play of
      the eyebrows observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you going to do now, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, really, I don&rsquo;t know. If Nikolai Petrovitch had kept his word and
      come, we should have gone shooting together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you really expected, sir, that he would come at the time he promised?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;m.&rsquo; Narkiz looked at me again and shook his head as it were with
      commiseration. &lsquo;If you &lsquo;d care to amuse yourself with reading,&rsquo; he
      continued: &lsquo;there are some books left of my old master&rsquo;s; I&rsquo;ll get them
      you, if you like; only you won&rsquo;t read them, I expect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re books of no value; not written for the gentlemen of these days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you read them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t read them, I wouldn&rsquo;t have spoken about them. A dream-book,
      for instance ... that&rsquo;s not much of a book, is it? There are others too,
      of course ... only you won&rsquo;t read them either.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are religious books.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was silent for a space.... Narkiz was silent too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What vexes me most,&rsquo; I began, &lsquo;is staying in the house in such weather.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take a walk in the garden; or go into the copse. We&rsquo;ve a copse here
      beyond the threshing-floor. Are you fond of fishing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are there fish here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, in the pond. Loaches, sand-eels, and perches are caught there. Now,
      to be sure, the best time is over; July&rsquo;s here. But anyway, you might
      try.... Shall I get the tackle ready?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, do please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send a boy with you ... to put on the worms. Or maybe I &lsquo;d better
      come myself?&rsquo; Narkiz obviously doubted whether I knew how to set about
      things properly by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, please, come along.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Narkiz, without a word, grinned from ear to ear, then suddenly knitted his
      brows ... and went out of the room.
    </p>

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Half an hour later we set off to catch fish. Narkiz had put on an
      extraordinary sort of cap with ears, and was more dignified than ever. He
      walked in front with a steady, even step; two rods swayed regularly up and
      down on his shoulders; a bare-legged boy followed him carrying a can and a
      pot of worms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, near the dike, there&rsquo;s a seat, put up on the floating platform on
      purpose,&rsquo; Narkiz was beginning to explain to me, but he glanced ahead, and
      suddenly exclaimed: &lsquo;Aha! but our poor folk are here already ... they keep
      it up, it seems.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I craned my head to look from behind him, and saw on the floating
      platform, on the very seat of which he had been speaking, two persons
      sitting with their backs to us; they were placidly fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are they?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Neighbours,&rsquo; Narkiz responded, with displeasure. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve nothing to eat
      at home, and so here they come to us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are they allowed to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old master allowed them.... Nikolai Petrovitch maybe won&rsquo;t give them
      permission.... The long one is a superannuated deacon&mdash;quite a silly
      creature; and as for the other, that&rsquo;s a little stouter&mdash;he&rsquo;s a
      brigadier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A brigadier?&rsquo; I repeated, wondering. This &lsquo;brigadier&rsquo;s&rsquo; attire was almost
      worse than the deacon&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I assure you he&rsquo;s a brigadier. And he did have a fine property once. But
      now he has only a corner given him out of charity, and he lives ... on
      what God sends him. But, by the way, what are we to do? They&rsquo;ve taken the
      best place.... We shall have to disturb our precious visitors.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Narkiz, please don&rsquo;t disturb them. We&rsquo;ll sit here a little aside;
      they won&rsquo;t interfere with us. I should like to make acquaintance with the
      brigadier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you like. Only, as far as acquaintance goes ... you needn&rsquo;t expect
      much satisfaction from it, sir; he&rsquo;s grown very weak in his head, and in
      conversation he&rsquo;s silly as a little child. As well he may be; he&rsquo;s past
      his eightieth year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vassily Fomitch. Guskov&rsquo;s his surname.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the deacon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The deacon? ... his nickname&rsquo;s Cucumber. Every one about here calls him
      so; but what his real name is&mdash;God knows! A foolish creature! A
      regular ne&rsquo;er-do-well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do they live together?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; but there&mdash;the devil has tied them together, it seems.&rsquo;

      V
    </h2>
    <p>
      We approached the platform. The brigadier cast one glance upon us ... and
      promptly fixed his eyes on the float; Cucumber jumped up, pulled back his
      rod, took off his worn-out clerical hat, passed a trembling hand over his
      rough yellow hair, made a sweeping bow, and gave vent to a feeble little
      laugh. His bloated face betrayed him an inveterate drunkard; his staring
      little eyes blinked humbly. He gave his neighbour a poke in the ribs, as
      though to let him know that they must clear out.... The brigadier began to
      move on the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit still, I beg; don&rsquo;t disturb yourselves,&rsquo; I hastened to say. &lsquo;You
      won&rsquo;t interfere with us in the least. We&rsquo;ll take up our position here; sit
      still.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cucumber wrapped his ragged smock round him, twitched his shoulders, his
      lips, his beard.... Obviously he felt our presence oppressive and he would
      have been glad to slink away, ... but the brigadier was again lost in the
      contemplation of his float.... The &lsquo;ne&rsquo;er-do-weel&rsquo; coughed twice, sat down
      on the very edge of the seat, put his hat on his knees, and, tucking his
      bare legs up under him, he discreetly dropped in his line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any bites?&rsquo; Narkiz inquired haughtily, as in leisurely fashion he unwound
      his reel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve caught a matter of five loaches,&rsquo; answered Cucumber in a cracked
      and husky voice: &lsquo;and he took a good-sized perch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, a perch,&rsquo; repeated the brigadier in a shrill pipe.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      I fell to watching closely&mdash;not him, but his reflection in the pond.
      It was as clearly reflected as in a looking-glass&mdash;a little darker, a
      little more silvery. The wide stretch of pond wafted a refreshing coolness
      upon us; a cool breath of air seemed to rise, too, from the steep, damp
      bank; and it was the sweeter, as in the dark blue, flooded with gold,
      above the tree tops, the stagnant sultry heat hung, a burden that could be
      felt, over our heads. There was no stir in the water near the dike; in the
      shade cast by the drooping bushes on the bank, water spiders gleamed, like
      tiny bright buttons, as they described their everlasting circles; at long
      intervals there was a faint ripple just perceptible round the floats, when
      a fish was &lsquo;playing&rsquo; with the worm. Very few fish were taken; during a
      whole hour we drew up only two loaches and an eel. I could not say why the
      brigadier aroused my curiosity; his rank could not have any influence on
      me; ruined noblemen were not even at that time looked upon as a rarity,
      and his appearance presented nothing remarkable. Under the warm cap, which
      covered the whole upper part of his head down to his ears and his
      eyebrows, could be seen a smooth, red, clean-shaven, round face, with a
      little nose, little lips, and small, clear grey eyes. Simplicity and
      weakness of character, and a sort of long-standing, helpless sorrow, were
      visible in that meek, almost childish face; the plump, white little hands
      with short fingers had something helpless, incapable about them too.... I
      could not conceive how this forlorn old man could once have been an
      officer, could have maintained discipline, have given his commands&mdash;and
      that, too, in the stern days of Catherine! I watched him; now and then he
      puffed out his cheeks and uttered a feeble whistle, like a little child;
      sometimes he screwed up his eyes painfully, with effort, as all decrepit
      people will. Once he opened his eyes wide and lifted them.... They stared
      at me from out of the depths of the water&mdash;and strangely touching and
      even full of meaning their dejected glance seemed to me.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      I tried to begin a conversation with the brigadier ... but Narkiz had not
      misinformed me; the poor old man certainly had become weak in his
      intellect. He asked me my surname, and after repeating his inquiry twice,
      pondered and pondered, and at last brought out: &lsquo;Yes, I fancy there was a
      judge of that name here. Cucumber, wasn&rsquo;t there a judge about here of that
      name, hey?&rsquo; &lsquo;To be sure there was, Vassily Fomitch, your honour,&rsquo; 
      responded Cucumber, who treated him altogether as a child. &lsquo;There was,
      certainly. But let me have your hook; your worm must have been eaten
      off.... Yes, so it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you know the Lomov family?&rsquo; the brigadier suddenly asked me in a
      cracked voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What Lomov family is that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Fiodor Ivanitch, Yevstigney Ivanitch, Alexey Ivanitch the Jew, and
      Fedulia Ivanovna the plunderer, ... and then, too ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brigadier suddenly broke off and looked down confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were the people he was most intimate with,&rsquo; Narkiz whispered, bending
      towards me; &lsquo;it was through them, through that same Alexey Ivanitch, that
      he called a Jew, and through a sister of Alexey Ivanitch&rsquo;s, Agrafena
      Ivanovna, as you may say, that he lost all his property.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you saying there about Agrafena Ivanovna?&rsquo; the brigadier called
      out suddenly, and his head was raised, his white eyebrows were
      frowning.... &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better mind! And why Agrafena, pray? Agrippina
      Ivanovna&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you should call her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&mdash;there&mdash;there, sir,&rsquo; Cucumber was beginning to falter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the verses the poet Milonov wrote about her?&rsquo; the old man
      went on, suddenly getting into a state of excitement, which was a complete
      surprise to me. &lsquo;No hymeneal lights were kindled,&rsquo; he began chanting,
      pronouncing all the vowels through his nose, giving the syllables &lsquo;an,&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;en,&rsquo; the nasal sound they have in French; and it was strange to hear this
      connected speech from his lips: &lsquo;No torches ... No, that&rsquo;s not it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Not vain Corruption&rsquo;s idols frail
  Not amaranth nor porphyry
  Rejoiced their hearts ...
  One thing in them ...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was about us. Do you hear?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;One thing in them unquenchable,
  Subduing, sweet, desirable,
  To nurse their mutual flame in love!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And you talk about Agrafena!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Narkiz chuckled half-contemptuously, half-indifferently. &lsquo;What a queer
      fish it is!&rsquo; he said to himself. But the brigadier had again relapsed into
      dejection, the rod had dropped from his hands and slipped into the water.

      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, to my thinking, our fishing is a poor business,&rsquo; observed Cucumber;
      &lsquo;the fish, see, don&rsquo;t bite at all. It&rsquo;s got fearfully hot, and there&rsquo;s a
      fit of &ldquo;mencholy&rdquo; come over our gentleman. It&rsquo;s clear we must be going
      home; that will be best.&rsquo; He cautiously drew out of his pocket a tin
      bottle with a wooden stopper, uncorked it, scattered snuff on his wrist,
      and sniffed it up in both nostrils at once.... &lsquo;Ah, what good snuff!&rsquo; he
      moaned, as he recovered himself. &lsquo;It almost made my tooth ache! Now, my
      dear Vassily Fomitch, get up&mdash;it&rsquo;s time to be off!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brigadier got up from the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you live far from here?&rsquo; I asked Cucumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, our gentleman lives not far ... it won&rsquo;t be as much as a mile.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you allow me to accompany you?&rsquo; I said, addressing the brigadier. I
      felt disinclined to let him go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Narkiz was surprised at my intention; but I paid no attention to the
      disapproving shake of his long-eared cap, and walked out of the garden
      with the brigadier, who was supported by Cucumber. The old man moved
      fairly quickly, with a motion as though he were on stilts.

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      We walked along a scarcely trodden path, through a grassy glade between
      two birch copses. The sun was blazing; the orioles called to each other in
      the green thicket; corncrakes chattered close to the path; blue
      butterflies fluttered in crowds about the white, and red flowers of the
      low-growing clover; in the perfectly still grass bees hung, as though
      asleep, languidly buzzing. Cucumber seemed to pull himself together, and
      brightened up; he was afraid of Narkiz&mdash;he lived always under his
      eye; I was a stranger&mdash;a new comer&mdash;with me he was soon quite at
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s our gentleman,&rsquo; he said in a rapid flow; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s a small eater and
      no mistake! but only one perch, is that enough for him? Unless, your
      honour, you would like to contribute something? Close here round the
      corner, at the little inn, there are first-rate white wheaten rolls. And
      if so, please your honour, this poor sinner, too, will gladly drink on
      this occasion to your health, and may it be of long years and long days.&rsquo; 
      I gave him a little silver, and was only just in time to pull away my
      hand, which he was falling upon to kiss. He learned that I was a
      sportsman, and fell to talking of a very good friend of his, an officer,
      who had a &lsquo;Mindindenger&rsquo; Swedish gun, with a copper stock, just like a
      cannon, so that when you fire it off you are almost knocked senseless&mdash;it
      had been left behind by the French&mdash;and a dog&mdash;simply one of
      Nature&rsquo;s marvels! that he himself had always had a great passion for the
      chase, and his priest would have made no trouble about it&mdash;he used in
      fact to catch quails with him&mdash;but the ecclesiastical superior had
      pursued him with endless persecution; &lsquo;and as for Narkiz Semyonitch,&rsquo; he
      observed in a sing-song tone, &lsquo;if according to his notions I&rsquo;m not a
      trustworthy person&mdash;well, what I say is: he&rsquo;s let his eyebrows grow
      till he&rsquo;s like a woodcock, and he fancies all the sciences are known to
      him.&rsquo; By this time we had reached the inn, a solitary tumble-down,
      one-roomed little hut without backyard or outbuildings; an emaciated dog
      lay curled up under the window; a hen was scratching in the dust under his
      very nose. Cucumber sat the brigadier down on the bank, and darted
      instantly into the hut. While he was buying the rolls and emptying a
      glass, I never took my eyes off the brigadier, who, God knows why, struck
      me as something of an enigma. In the life of this man&mdash;so I mused&mdash;there
      must certainly have been something out of the ordinary. But he, it seemed,
      did not notice me at all. He was sitting huddled up on the bank, and
      twisting in his fingers some pinks which he had gathered in my friend&rsquo;s
      garden. Cucumber made his appearance, at last, with a bundle of rolls in
      his hand; he made his appearance, all red and perspiring, with an
      expression of gleeful surprise on his face, as though he had just seen
      something exceedingly agreeable and unexpected. He at once offered the
      brigadier a roll to eat, and the latter at once ate it. We proceeded on
      our way.

    <p>
      On the strength of the spirits he had drunk, Cucumber quite &lsquo;unbent,&rsquo; as
      it is called. He began trying to cheer up the brigadier, who was still
      hurrying forward with a tottering motion as though he were on stilts. &lsquo;Why
      are you so downcast, sir, and hanging your head? Let me sing you a song.
      That&rsquo;ll cheer you up in a minute.&rsquo; He turned to me: &lsquo;Our gentleman is very
      fond of a joke, mercy on us, yes! Yesterday, what did I see?&mdash;a
      peasant-woman washing a pair of breeches on the platform, and a great fat
      woman she was, and he stood behind her, simply all of a shake with
      laughter&mdash;yes, indeed! ... In a minute, allow me: do you know the
      song of the hare? You mustn&rsquo;t judge me by my looks; there&rsquo;s a gypsy woman
      living here in the town, a perfect fright, but sings&mdash;&lsquo;pon my soul!
      one&rsquo;s ready to lie down and die.&rsquo; He opened wide his moist red lips and
      began singing, his head on one side, his eyes shut, and his beard
      quivering:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The hare beneath the bush lies still,
  The hunters vainly scour the hill;
  The hare lies hid and holds his breath,
  His ears pricked up, he lies there still
       Waiting for death.
  O hunters! what harm have I done,
  To vex or injure you? Although
  Among the cabbages I run,
  One leaf I nibble&mdash;only one,
       And that&rsquo;s not yours!
          Oh, no!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Cucumber went on with ever-increasing energy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Into the forest dark he fled,
  His tail he let the hunters see;
  &ldquo;Excuse me, gentlemen,&rdquo; says he,
  &ldquo;That so I turn my back on you&mdash;
       I am not yours!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Cucumber was not singing now ... he was bellowing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The hunters hunted day and night,
  And still the hare was out of sight.
  So, talking over his misdeeds,
  They ended by disputing quite&mdash;
       Alas, the hare is not for us!
         The squint-eye is too sharp for us!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      The first two lines of each stanza Cucumber sang with each syllable drawn
      out; the other three, on the contrary, very briskly, and accompanied them
      with little hops and shuffles of his feet; at the conclusion of each verse
      he cut a caper, in which he kicked himself with his own heels. As he
      shouted at the top of his voice: &lsquo;The squint-eye is too sharp for us!&rsquo; he
      turned a somersault.... His expectations were fulfilled. The brigadier
      suddenly went off into a thin, tearful little chuckle, and laughed so
      heartily that he could not go on, and stayed still in a half-sitting
      posture, helplessly slapping his knees with his hands. I looked at his
      face, flushed crimson, and convulsively working, and felt very sorry for
      him at that instant especially. Encouraged by his success, Cucumber fell
      to capering about in a squatting position, singing the refrain of:
      &lsquo;Shildi-budildi!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Natchiki-tchikaldi!&rsquo; He stumbled at last with his
      nose in the dust.... The brigadier suddenly ceased laughing and hobbled
      on.

    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      We went on another quarter of a mile. A little village came into sight on
      the edge of a not very deep ravine; on one side stood the &lsquo;lodge,&rsquo; with a
      half-ruined roof and a solitary chimney; in one of the two rooms of this
      lodge lived the brigadier. The owner of the village, who always resided in
      Petersburg, the widow of the civil councillor Lomov, had&mdash;so I
      learned later&mdash;bestowed this little nook upon the brigadier. She had
      given orders that he should receive a monthly pension, and had also
      assigned for his service a half-witted serf-girl living in the same
      village, who, though she barely understood human speech, was yet capable,
      in the lady&rsquo;s opinion, of sweeping a floor and cooking cabbage-soup. At
      the door of the lodge the brigadier again addressed me with the same
      eighteenth-century smile: would I be pleased to walk into his
      &lsquo;apartement&rsquo;? We went into this &lsquo;apartement.&rsquo; Everything in it was
      exceedingly filthy and poor, so filthy and so poor that the brigadier,
      noticing, probably, by the expression of my face, the impression it made
      on me, observed, shrugging his shoulders, and half closing his eyelids:
      &lsquo;Ce n&rsquo;est pas ... oeil de perdrix.&rsquo; ... What precisely he meant by this
      remained a mystery to me.... When I addressed him in French, I got no
      reply from him in that language. Two objects struck me especially in the
      brigadier&rsquo;s abode: a large officer&rsquo;s cross of St. George in a black frame,
      under glass, with an inscription in an old-fashioned handwriting:
      &lsquo;Received by the Colonel of the Tchernigov regiment, Vassily Guskov, for
      the storming of Prague in the year 1794&rsquo;; and secondly, a half-length
      portrait in oils of a handsome, black-eyed woman with a long, dark face,
      hair turned up high and powdered, with postiches on the temple and chin,
      in a flowered, low-cut bodice, with blue frills, the style of 1780. The
      portrait was badly painted, but was probably a good likeness; there was a
      wonderful look of life and will, something extraordinarily living and
      resolute, about the face. It was not looking at the spectator; it was, as
      it were, turning away and not smiling; the curve of the thin nose, the
      regular but flat lips, the almost unbroken straight line of the thick
      eyebrows, all showed an imperious, haughty, fiery temper. No great effort
      was needed to picture that face glowing with passion or with rage. Just
      below the portrait on a little pedestal stood a half-withered bunch of
      simple wild flowers in a thick glass jar. The brigadier went up to the
      pedestal, stuck the pinks he was carrying into the jar, and turning to me,
      and lifting his hand in the direction of the portrait, he observed:
      &lsquo;Agrippina Ivanovna Teliegin, by birth Lomov.&rsquo; The words of Narkiz came
      back to my mind; and I looked with redoubled interest at the expressive
      and evil face of the woman for whose sake the brigadier had lost all his
      fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You took part, I see, sir, in the storming of Prague,&rsquo; I began, pointing
      to the St. George cross, &lsquo;and won a sign of distinction, rare at any time,
      but particularly so then; you must remember Suvorov?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alexander Vassilitch?&rsquo; the brigadier answered, after a brief silence, in
      which he seemed to be pulling his thoughts together; &lsquo;to be sure, I
      remember him; he was a little, brisk old man. Before one could stir a
      finger, he&rsquo;d be here and there and everywhere (the brigadier chuckled). He
      rode into Warsaw on a Cossack horse; he was all in diamonds, and he says
      to the Poles: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no watch, I forgot it in Petersburg&mdash;no watch!&rdquo;
       and they shouted and huzzaed for him. Queer chaps! Hey! Cucumber! lad!&rsquo; he
      added suddenly, changing and raising his voice (the deacon-buffoon had
      remained standing at the door), &lsquo;where&rsquo;s the rolls, eh? And tell Grunka
      ... to bring some kvas!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Directly, your honour,&rsquo; I heard Cucumber&rsquo;s voice reply. He handed the
      brigadier the bundle of rolls, and, going out of the lodge, approached a
      dishevelled creature in rags&mdash;the half-witted girl, Grunka, I suppose&mdash;and
      as far as I could make out through the dusty little window, proceeded to
      demand kvas from her&mdash;at least, he several times raised one hand like
      a funnel to his mouth, and waved the other in our direction.

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      I made another attempt to get into conversation with the brigadier; but he
      was evidently tired: he sank, sighing and groaning, on the little couch,
      and moaning, &lsquo;Oy, oy, my poor bones, my poor bones,&rsquo; untied his garters. I
      remember I wondered at the time how a man came to be wearing garters. I
      did not realise that in former days every one wore them. The brigadier
      began yawning with prolonged, unconcealed yawns, not taking his drowsy
      eyes off me all the time; so very little children yawn. The poor old man
      did not even seem quite to understand my question.... And he had taken
      Prague! He, sword in hand, in the smoke and the dust&mdash;at the head of
      Suvorov&rsquo;s soldiers, the bullet-pierced flag waving above him, the hideous
      corpses under his feet.... He ... he! Wasn&rsquo;t it wonderful! But yet I could
      not help fancying that there had been events more extraordinary in the
      brigadier&rsquo;s life. Cucumber brought white kvas in an iron jug; the
      brigadier drank greedily&mdash;his hands shook. Cucumber supported the
      bottom of the jug. The old man carefully wiped his toothless mouth with
      both hands&mdash;and again staring at me, fell to chewing and munching his
      lips. I saw how it was, bowed, and went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now he&rsquo;ll have a nap,&rsquo; observed Cucumber, coming out behind me. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
      terribly knocked up to-day&mdash;he went to the grave early this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To whose grave?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Agrafena Ivanovna&rsquo;s, to pay his devotions.... She is buried in our
      parish cemetery here; it&rsquo;ll be four miles from here. Vassily Fomitch
      visits it every week without fail. Indeed, it was he who buried her and
      put the fence up at his own expense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has she been dead long?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, let&rsquo;s think&mdash;twenty years about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was she a friend of his, or what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her whole life, you may say, she passed with him ... really. I myself, I
      must own, never knew the lady, but they do say ... what there was between
      them ... well, well, well! Sir,&rsquo; the deacon added hurriedly, seeing I had
      turned away, &lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t you like to give me something for another drop, for
      it&rsquo;s time I was home in my hut and rolled up in my blanket?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it useless to question Cucumber further, so gave him a few
      coppers, and set off homewards.

    <h2>
      XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      At home I betook myself for further information to Narkiz. He, as I might
      have anticipated, was somewhat unapproachable, stood a little on his
      dignity, expressed his surprise that such paltry matters could &lsquo;interest&rsquo; 
      me, and, finally, told me what he knew. I heard the following details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassily Fomitch Guskov had become acquainted with Agrafena Ivanovna
      Teliegin at Moscow soon after the suppression of the Polish insurrection;
      her husband had had a post under the governor-general, and Vassily Fomitch
      was on furlough. He fell in love with her there and then, but did not
      leave the army at once; he was a man of forty with no family, with a
      fortune. Her husband soon after died. She was left without children, poor,
      and in debt.... Vassily Fomitch heard of her position, threw up the
      service (he received the rank of brigadier on his retirement) and sought
      out his charming widow, who was not more than five-and-twenty, paid all
      her debts, redeemed her estate.... From that time he had never parted from
      her, and finished by living altogether in her house. She, too, seems to
      have cared for him, but would not marry him. &lsquo;She was froward, the
      deceased lady,&rsquo; was Narkiz&rsquo;s comment on this: &lsquo;My liberty,&rsquo; she would say,
      &lsquo;is dearer to me than anything.&rsquo; But as for making use of him&mdash;she
      made use of him &lsquo;in every possible way,&rsquo; and whatever money he had, he
      dragged to her like an ant. But the frowardness of Agrafena Ivanovna at
      times assumed extreme proportions; she was not of a mild temper, and
      somewhat too ready with her hands.... Once she pushed her page-boy down
      the stairs, and he went and broke two of his ribs and one leg.... Agrafena
      Ivanovna was frightened ... she promptly ordered the page to be shut up in
      the lumber-room, and she did not leave the house nor give up the key of
      the room to any one, till the moans within had ceased.... The page was
      secretly buried.... &lsquo;And had it been in the Empress Catherine&rsquo;s time,&rsquo; 
      Narkiz added in a whisper, bending down, &lsquo;maybe the affair would have
      ended there&mdash;many such deeds were hidden under a bushel in those
      days, but as ...&rsquo; here Narkiz drew himself up and raised his voice:&rsquo; as
      our righteous Tsar Alexander the Blessed was reigning then ... well, a
      fuss was made.... A trial followed, the body was dug up ... signs of
      violence were found on it ... and a great to-do there was. And what do you
      think? Vassily Fomitch took it all on himself. &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;am
      responsible for it all; it was I pushed him down, and I too shut him up.&rdquo;
       Well, of course, all the judges then, and the lawyers and the police ...
      fell on him directly ... fell on him and never let him go ... I can assure
      you ... till the last farthing was out of his purse. They&rsquo;d leave him in
      peace for a while, and then attack him again. Down to the very time when
      the French came into Russia they were worrying at him, and only dropped
      him then. Well, he managed to provide for Agrafena Ivanovna&mdash;to be
      sure, he saved her&mdash;that one must say. Well, and afterwards, up to
      her death, indeed, he lived with her, and they do say she led him a pretty
      dance&mdash;the brigadier, that is; sent him on foot from Moscow into the
      country&mdash;by God, she did&mdash;to get her rents in, I suppose. It was
      on her account, on account of this same Agrafena Ivanovna&mdash;he fought
      a duel with the English milord Hugh Hughes; and the English milord was
      forced to make a formal apology too. But later on the brigadier went down
      hill more and more.... Well, and now he can&rsquo;t be reckoned a man at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who was that Alexey Ivanitch the Jew,&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;through whom he was
      brought to ruin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the brother of Agrafena Ivanovna. A grasping creature, Jewish indeed.
      He lent his sister money at interest, and Vassily Fomitch was her
      security. He had to pay for it too ... pretty heavily!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Fedulia Ivanovna the plunderer&mdash;who was she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her sister too ... and a sharp one too, as sharp as a lance. A terrible
      woman!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a place to find a Werter!&rsquo; I thought next day, as I set off again
      towards the brigadier&rsquo;s dwelling. I was at that time very young, and that
      was possibly why I thought it my duty not to believe in the lasting nature
      of love. Still, I was impressed and somewhat puzzled by the story I had
      heard, and felt an intense desire to stir up the old man, to make him talk
      freely. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll first refer to Suvorov again,&rsquo; so I resolved within myself;
      &lsquo;there must be some spark of his former fire hidden within him still ...
      and then, when he&rsquo;s warmed up, I&rsquo;ll turn the conversation on that ...
      what&rsquo;s her name? ... Agrafena Ivanovna. A queer name for a &ldquo;Charlotte&rdquo;&mdash;Agrafena!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      I found my Werter-Guskov in the middle of a tiny kitchen-garden, a few
      steps from the lodge, near the old framework of a never-finished hut,
      overgrown with nettles. On the mildewed upper beams of this skeleton hut
      some miserable-looking turkey poults were scrambling, incessantly slipping
      and flapping their wings and cackling. There was some poor sort of green
      stuff growing in two or three borders. The brigadier had just pulled a
      young carrot out of the ground, and rubbing it under his arm &lsquo;to clean
      it,&rsquo; proceeded to chew its thin tail.... I bowed to him, and inquired
      after his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      He obviously did not recognise me, though he returned my greeting&mdash;that
      is to say, touched his cap with his hand, though without leaving off
      munching the carrot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t go fishing to-day?&rsquo; I began, in the hope of recalling myself
      to his memory by this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-day?&rsquo; he repeated and pondered ... while the carrot, stuck into his
      mouth, grew shorter and shorter. &lsquo;Why, I suppose it&rsquo;s Cucumber fishing!
      ... But I&rsquo;m allowed to, too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, of course, most honoured Vassily Fomitch.... I didn&rsquo;t mean
      that.... But aren&rsquo;t you hot ... like this in the sun.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brigadier was wearing a thick wadded dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh? Hot?&rsquo; he repeated again, as though puzzled over the question, and,
      having finally swallowed the carrot, he gazed absently upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you care to step into my apartement?&rsquo; he said suddenly. The poor
      old man had, it seemed, only this phrase still left him always at his
      disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went out of the kitchen-garden ... but there involuntarily I stopped
      short. Between us and the lodge stood a huge bull. With his head down to
      the ground, and a malignant gleam in his eyes, he was snorting heavily and
      furiously, and with a rapid movement of one fore-leg, he tossed the dust
      up in the air with his broad cleft hoof, lashed his sides with his tail,
      and suddenly backing a little, shook his shaggy neck stubbornly, and
      bellowed&mdash;not loud, but plaintively, and at the same time menacingly.
      I was, I confess, alarmed; but Vassily Fomitch stepped forward with
      perfect composure, and saying in a stern voice, &lsquo;Now then, country
      bumpkin,&rsquo; shook his handkerchief at him. The bull backed again, bowed his
      horns ... suddenly rushed to one side and ran away, wagging his head from
      side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt he took Prague,&rsquo; I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went into the room. The brigadier pulled his cap off his hair, which
      was soaked with perspiration, ejaculated, &lsquo;Fa!&rsquo; ... squatted down on the
      edge of a chair ... bowed his head gloomily....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come to you, Vassily Fomitch,&rsquo; I began my diplomatic approaches,
      &lsquo;because, as you have served under the leadership of the great Suvorov&mdash;have
      taken part altogether in such important events&mdash;it would be very
      interesting for me to hear some particulars of your past.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brigadier stared at me.... His face kindled strangely&mdash;I began to
      expect, if not a story, at least some word of approval, of sympathy....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I, sir, must be going to die soon,&rsquo; he said in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was utterly nonplussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Vassily Fomitch, &lsquo;I brought out at last, &lsquo;what makes you ... suppose
      that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brigadier suddenly flung his arms violently up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, sir ... I, as maybe you know ... often in my dreams see
      Agrippina Ivanovna&mdash;Heaven&rsquo;s peace be with her!&mdash;and never can I
      catch her; I am always running after her&mdash;but cannot catch her. But
      last night&mdash;I dreamed&mdash;she was standing, as it were, before me,
      half-turned away, and laughing.... I ran up to her at once and caught her
      ... and she seemed to turn round quite and said to me: &ldquo;Well, Vassinka,
      now you have caught me.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you conclude from that, Vassily Fomitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, sir, I conclude: it has come, that we shall be together. And glory
      to God for it, I tell you; glory be to God Almighty, the Father, the Son,
      and the Holy Ghost (the brigadier fell into a chant): as it was in the
      beginning, is now and ever shall be, Amen!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brigadier began crossing himself. I could get nothing more out of him,
      so I went away.

    <h2>
      XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day my friend arrived.... I mentioned the brigadier, and my
      visits to him....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes! of course! I know his story,&rsquo; answered my friend; &lsquo;I know Madame
      Lomov very well, the privy councillor&rsquo;s widow, by whose favour he obtained
      a home here. Oh, wait a minute; I believe there must be preserved here his
      letter to the privy councillor&rsquo;s widow; it was on the strength of that
      letter that she assigned him his little cot.&rsquo; My friend rummaged among his
      papers and actually found the brigadier&rsquo;s letter. Here it is word for
      word, with the omission of the mistakes in spelling. The brigadier, like
      every one of his epoch, was a little hazy in that respect. But to preserve
      these errors seemed unnecessary; his letter bears the stamp of his age
      without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;HONOURED MADAM, RAÏSSA PAVLOVNA!&mdash;On the decease of my friend, and
      your aunt, I had the happiness of addressing to you two letters, the first
      on the first of June, the second on the sixth of July of the year 1815,
      while she expired on the sixth of May in that year; in them I discovered
      to you the feelings of my soul and of my heart, which were crushed under
      deadly wrongs, and they reflected in full my bitter despair, in truth
      deserving of commiseration; both letters were despatched by the imperial
      mail registered, and hence I cannot conceive that they have not been
      perused by your eye. By the genuine candour of my letters, I had counted
      upon winning your benevolent attention; but the compassionate feelings of
      your heart were far removed from me in my woe! Left on the loss of my one
      only friend, Agrippina Ivanovna, in the most distressed and
      poverty-stricken circumstances, I rested, by her instructions, all my
      hopes on your bounty; she, aware of her end approaching, said to me in
      these words, as it were from the grave, and never can I forget them: &ldquo;My
      friend, I have been your serpent, and am guilty of all your unhappiness. I
      feel how much you have sacrificed for me, and in return I leave you in a
      disastrous and truly destitute situation; on my death have recourse to
      Raïssa Pavlovna&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to you&mdash;&ldquo;and implore her aid, invite
      her succour! She has a feeling heart, and I have confidence in her, that
      she will not leave you forlorn.&rdquo; Honoured madam, let me call to witness
      the all-high Creator of the world that those were her words, and I am
      speaking with her tongue; and, therefore, trusting firmly in your
      goodness, to you first of all I addressed myself with my open-hearted and
      candid letters; but after protracted expectation, receiving no reply to
      them, I could not conceive otherwise than that your benevolent heart had
      left me without attention! Such your unfavourable disposition towards me,
      reduced me to the depths of despair&mdash;whither, and to whom, was I to
      turn in my misfortune I knew not; my soul was troubled, my intellect went
      astray; at last, for the completion of my ruin, it pleased Providence to
      chastise me in a still more cruel manner, and to turn my thoughts to your
      deceased aunt, Fedulia Ivanovna, sister of Agrippina Ivanovna, one in
      blood, but not one in heart! Having present to myself, before my mind&rsquo;s
      eye, that I had been for twenty years devoted to the whole family of your
      kindred, the Lomovs, especially to Fedulia Ivanovna, who never called
      Agrippina Ivanovna otherwise than &ldquo;my heart&rsquo;s precious treasure,&rdquo; and me
      &ldquo;the most honoured and zealous friend of our family&rdquo;; picturing all the
      above, among abundant tears and sighs in the stillness of sorrowful night
      watches, I thought: &ldquo;Come, brigadier! so, it seems, it is to be!&rdquo; and,
      addressing myself by letter to the said Fedulia Ivanovna, I received a
      positive assurance that she would share her last crumb with me! The
      presents sent on by me, more than five hundred roubles&rsquo; worth in value,
      were accepted with supreme satisfaction; and afterwards the money too
      which I brought with me for my maintenance, Fedulia Ivanovna was pleased,
      on the pretext of guarding it, to take into her care, to the which, to
      gratify her, I offered no opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ask me whence, and on what ground I conceived such confidence&mdash;to
      the above, madam, there is but one reply: she was sister of Agrippina
      Ivanovna, and a member of the Lomov family! But alas and alas! all the
      money aforesaid I was very soon deprived of, and the hopes which I had
      rested on Fedulia Ivanovna&mdash;that she would share her last crumb with
      me&mdash;turned out to be empty and vain; on the contrary, the said
      Fedulia Ivanovna enriched herself with my property. To wit, on her saint&rsquo;s
      day, the fifth of February, I brought her fifty roubles&rsquo; worth of green
      French material, at five roubles the yard; I myself received of all that
      was promised five roubles&rsquo; worth of white piqué for a waistcoat and a
      muslin handkerchief for my neck, which gifts were purchased in my
      presence, as I was aware, with my own money&mdash;and that was all that I
      profited by Fedulia Ivanovna&rsquo;s bounty! So much for the last crumb! And I
      could further, in all sincerity, disclose the malignant doings of Fedulia
      Ivanovna to me; and also my expenses, exceeding all reason, as, among the
      rest, for sweetmeats and fruits, of which Fedulia Ivanovna was exceedingly
      fond;&mdash;but upon all this I am silent, that you may not take such
      disclosures against the dead in bad part; and also, seeing that God has
      called her before His judgment seat&mdash;and all that I suffered at her
      hands is blotted out from my heart&mdash;and I, as a Christian, forgave
      her long ago, and pray to God to forgive her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, honoured madam, Raïssa Pavlovna! Surely you will not blame me for
      that I was a true and loyal friend of your family, and that I loved
      Agrippina Ivanovna with a love so great and so insurmountable that I
      sacrificed to her my life, my honour, and all my fortune! that I was
      utterly in her hands, and hence could not dispose of myself nor of my
      property, and she disposed at her will of me and also of my estate! It is
      known to you also that, owing to her action with her servant, I suffer,
      though innocent, a deadly wrong&mdash;this affair I brought after her
      death before the senate, before the sixth department&mdash;it is still
      unsettled now&mdash;in consequence of which I was made accomplice with
      her, my estate put under guardianship, and I am still lying under a
      criminal charge! In my position, at my age, such disgrace is intolerable
      to me; and it is only left me to console my heart with the mournful
      reflection that thus, even after Agrippina Ivanovna&rsquo;s death, I suffer for
      her sake, and so prove my immutable love and loyal gratitude to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In my letters, above mentioned, to you, I gave you an account with every
      detail of Agrippina Ivanovna&rsquo;s funeral, and what masses were read for her&mdash;my
      affection and love for her spared no outlay! For all the aforesaid, and
      for the forty days&rsquo; requiems, and the reading of the psalter six weeks
      after for her (in addition to above, fifty roubles of mine were lost,
      which were given as security for payment for the stone, of which I sent
      you a description)&mdash;on all the aforesaid was spent of my money seven
      hundred and fifty roubles, in which is included, by way of donation to the
      church, a hundred and fifty roubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the goodness of your heart, hear the cry of a desperate man, crushed
      beneath a load of the crudest calamities! Only your commiseration and
      humanity can restore the life of a ruined man! Though living&mdash;in the
      suffering of my heart and soul I am as one dead; dead when I think what I
      was, and what I am; I was a soldier, and served my country in all fidelity
      and uprightness, as is the bounden duty of a loyal Russian and faithful
      subject, and was rewarded with the highest honours, and had a fortune
      befitting my birth and station; and now I must cringe and beg for a morsel
      of dry bread; dead above all I am when I think what a friend I have lost
      ... and what is life to me after that? But there is no hastening one&rsquo;s
      end, and the earth will not open, but rather seems turned to stone! And so
      I call upon you, in the benevolence of your heart, hush the talk of the
      people, do not expose yourself to universal censure, that for all my
      unbounded devotion I have not where to lay my head; confound them by your
      bounty to me, turn the tongues of the evil speakers and slanderers to
      glorifying your good works&mdash;and I make bold in all humility to add,
      comfort in the grave your most precious aunt, Agrippina Ivanovna, who can
      never be forgotten, and who for your speedy succour, in answer to my
      sinful prayers, will spread her protecting wings about your head, and
      comfort in his declining days a lonely old man, who had every reason to
      expect a different fate! ... And, with the most profound respect, I have
      the honour to be, dear madam, your most devoted servant,
    </p>
    <h3>
      VASSILY GUSKOV,
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Brigadier and cavalier.</i>&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Several years later I paid another visit to my friend&rsquo;s little place....
      Vassily Fomitch had long been dead; he died soon after I made his
      acquaintance. Cucumber was still flourishing. He conducted me to the tomb
      of Agrafena Ivanovna. An iron railing enclosed a large slab with a
      detailed and enthusiastically laudatory epitaph on the deceased woman; and
      there, beside it, as it were at her feet, could be seen a little mound
      with a slanting cross on it; the servant of God, the brigadier and
      cavalier, Vassily Guskov, lay under this mound.... His ashes found rest at
      last beside the ashes of the creature he had loved with such unbounded,
      almost undying, love.

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the year 182- ... there was living in the town of O&mdash;&mdash; the
      lieutenant Ivan Afanasiitch Pyetushkov. He was born of poor parents, was
      left an orphan at five years old, and came into the charge of a guardian.
      Thanks to this guardian, he found himself with no property whatever; he
      had a hard struggle to make both ends meet. He was of medium height, and
      stooped a little; he had a thin face, covered with freckles, but rather
      pleasing; light brown hair, grey eyes, and a timid expression; his low
      forehead was furrowed with fine wrinkles. Pyetushkov&rsquo;s whole life had been
      uneventful in the extreme; at close upon forty he was still youthful and
      inexperienced as a child. He was shy with acquaintances, and exceedingly
      mild in his manner with persons over whose lot he could have exerted
      control....
    </p>
    <p>
      People condemned by fate to a monotonous and cheerless existence often
      acquire all sorts of little habits and preferences. Pyetushkov liked to
      have a new white roll with his tea every morning. He could not do without
      this dainty. But behold one morning his servant, Onisim, handed him, on a
      blue-sprigged plate, instead of a roll, three dark red rusks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov at once asked his servant, with some indignation, what he meant
      by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rolls have all been sold out,&rsquo; answered Onisim, a native of
      Petersburg, who had been flung by some queer freak of destiny into the
      very wilds of south Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo; exclaimed Ivan Afanasiitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sold out,&rsquo; repeated Onisim; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a breakfast at the Marshal&rsquo;s, so
      they&rsquo;ve all gone there, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim waved his hand in the air, and thrust his right foot forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch walked up and down the room, dressed, and set off himself
      to the baker&rsquo;s shop. This establishment, the only one of the kind in the
      town of O&mdash;&mdash;, had been opened ten years before by a German
      immigrant, had in a short time begun to flourish, and was still
      flourishing under the guidance of his widow, a fat woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov tapped at the window. The fat woman stuck her unhealthy,
      flabby, sleepy countenance out of the pane that opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A roll, if you please,&rsquo; Pyetushkov said amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rolls are all gone,&rsquo; piped the fat woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any rolls?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s that?&mdash;really! I take rolls from you every day, and pay for
      them regularly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman stared at him in silence. &lsquo;Take twists,&rsquo; she said at last,
      yawning; &lsquo;or a scone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like them,&rsquo; said Pyetushkov, and he felt positively hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you please,&rsquo; muttered the fat woman, and she slammed to the
      window-pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch was quite unhinged by his intense vexation. In his
      perturbation he crossed to the other side of the street, and gave himself
      up entirely, like a child, to his displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo; ... he heard a rather agreeable female voice; &lsquo;sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch raised his eyes. From the open pane of the bakehouse
      window peeped a girl of about seventeen, holding a white roll in her hand.
      She had a full round face, rosy cheeks, small hazel eyes, rather a turn-up
      nose, fair hair, and magnificent shoulders. Her features suggested
      good-nature, laziness, and carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a roll for you, sir,&rsquo; she said, laughing, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d taken for myself;
      but take it, please, I&rsquo;ll give it up to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank you most sincerely. Allow me ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov began fumbling in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no! you are welcome to it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the window-pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov arrived home in a perfectly agreeable frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t get any rolls,&rsquo; he said to his Onisim; &lsquo;but here, I&rsquo;ve got
      one, do you see?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim gave a bitter laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day, in the evening, as Ivan Afanasiitch was undressing, he asked
      his servant, &lsquo;Tell me, please, my lad, what&rsquo;s the girl like at the
      baker&rsquo;s, hey?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim looked away rather gloomily, and responded, &lsquo;What do you want to
      know for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nothing,&rsquo; said Pyetushkov, taking off his boots with his own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a fine girl!&rsquo; Onisim observed condescendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, ... she&rsquo;s not bad-looking,&rsquo; said Ivan Afanasiitch, also looking
      away. &lsquo;And what&rsquo;s her name, do you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vassilissa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do you know her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim did not answer for a minute or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We know her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov was on the point of opening his mouth again, but he turned over
      on the other side and fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim went out into the passage, took a pinch of snuff, and gave his head
      a violent shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, early in the morning, Pyetushkov called for his clothes.
      Onisim brought him his everyday coat&mdash;an old grass-coloured coat,
      with huge striped epaulettes. Pyetushkov gazed a long while at Onisim
      without speaking, then told him to bring him his new coat. Onisim, with
      some surprise, obeyed. Pyetushkov dressed, and carefully drew on his
      chamois-leather gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t go to the baker&rsquo;s to-day,&rsquo; said he with some hesitation; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      going myself, ... it&rsquo;s on my way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; responded Onisim, as abruptly as if some one had just given
      him a shove from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov set off, reached the baker&rsquo;s shop, tapped at the window. The
      fat woman opened the pane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me a roll, please,&rsquo; Ivan Afanasiitch articulated slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat woman stuck out an arm, bare to the shoulder&mdash;a huge arm,
      more like a leg than an arm&mdash;and thrust the hot bread just under his
      nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch stood some time under the window, walked once or twice up
      and down the street, glanced into the courtyard, and at last, ashamed of
      his childishness, returned home with the roll in his hand. He felt ill at
      ease the whole day, and even in the evening, contrary to his habit, did
      not drop into conversation with Onisim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning it was Onisim who went for the roll.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some weeks went by. Ivan Afanasiitch had completely forgotten Vassilissa,
      and chatted in a friendly way with his servant as before. One fine morning
      there came to see him a certain Bublitsyn, an easy-mannered and very
      agreeable young man. It is true he sometimes hardly knew himself what he
      was talking about, and was always, as they say, a little wild; but all the
      same he had the reputation of being an exceedingly agreeable person to
      talk to. He smoked a great deal with feverish eagerness, with lifted
      eyebrows and contracted chest&mdash;smoked with an expression of intense
      anxiety, or, one might rather say, with an expression as though, let him
      have this one more puff at his pipe, and in a minute he would tell you
      some quite unexpected piece of news; at times he would even give a grunt
      and a wave of the hand, while himself sucking at his pipe, as though he
      had suddenly recollected something extraordinarily amusing or important,
      then he would open his mouth, let off a few rings of smoke, and utter the
      most commonplace remarks, or even keep silence altogether. After gossiping
      a little with Ivan Afanasiitch about the neighbours, about horses, the
      daughters of the gentry around, and other such edifying topics, Mr.
      Bublitsyn suddenly winked, pulled up his shock of hair, and, with a sly
      smile, approached the remarkably dim looking-glass which was the solitary
      ornament of Ivan Afanasiitch&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no denying the fact,&rsquo; he pronounced, stroking his light brown
      whiskers, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve got girls here that beat any of your Venus of Medicis
      hollow.... Have you seen Vassilissa, the baker girl, for instance?&rsquo; ...
      Mr. Bublitsyn sucked at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why do I ask you?&rsquo; pursued Bublitsyn, disappearing in a cloud of
      smoke,&mdash;&lsquo;you&rsquo;re not the man to notice, don&rsquo;t you know, Ivan
      Afanasiitch! Goodness knows what you do to occupy yourself, Ivan
      Afanasiitch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same as you do,&rsquo; Pyetushkov replied with some vexation, in a drawling
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no, Ivan Afanasiitch, not a bit of it.... How can you say so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense, nonsense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why so, why so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bublitsyn stuck his pipe in the corner of his mouth, and began
      scrutinising his not very handsome boots. Pyetushkov felt embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Ivan Afanasiitch, Ivan Afanasiitch!&rsquo; pursued Bublitsyn, as though
      sparing his feelings. &lsquo;But as to Vassilissa, the baker girl, I can assure
      you: a very, ve-ry fine girl, ... ve-ry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bublitsyn dilated his nostrils, and slowly plunged his hands into his
      pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to relate, Ivan Afanasiitch felt something of the nature of
      jealousy. He began moving restlessly in his chair, burst into explosive
      laughter at nothing at all, suddenly blushed, yawned, and, as he yawned,
      his lower jaw twitched a little. Bublitsyn smoked three more pipes, and
      withdrew. Ivan Afanasiitch went to the window, sighed, and called for
      something to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim set a glass of kvas on the table, glanced severely at his master,
      leaned back against the door, and hung his head dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you so thoughtful about?&rsquo; his master asked him genially, but
      with some inward trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What am I thinking about?&rsquo; retorted Onisim; &lsquo;what am I thinking about?
      ... it&rsquo;s always about you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it&rsquo;s about you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what is it you are thinking?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, this is what I&rsquo;m thinking.&rsquo; (Here Onisim took a pinch of snuff.)
      &lsquo;You ought to be ashamed, sir&mdash;you ought to be ashamed of yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ashamed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, ashamed.... Look at Mr. Bublitsyn, Ivan Afanasiitch.... Tell me if
      he&rsquo;s not a fine fellow, now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t understand me.... Oh yes, you do understand me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Bublitsyn&rsquo;s a real gentleman&mdash;what a gentleman ought to be. But
      what are you, Ivan Afanasiitch, what are you? Tell me that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;m a gentleman too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentleman, indeed!&rsquo; ... retorted Onisim, growing indignant. &lsquo;A pretty
      gentleman you are! You&rsquo;re no better, sir, than a hen in a shower of rain,
      Ivan Afanasiitch, let me tell you. Here you sit sticking at home the whole
      blessed day ... much good it does you, sitting at home like that! You
      don&rsquo;t play cards, you don&rsquo;t go and see the gentry, and as for ... well
      ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim waved his hand expressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, come ... you really go ... too far ...&rsquo; Ivan Afanasiitch said
      hesitatingly, clutching his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Too far, indeed, Ivan Afanasiitch, too far, you say! Judge for yourself.
      Here again, with Vassilissa ... why couldn&rsquo;t you ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what are you thinking about, Onisim,&rsquo; Pyetushkov interrupted
      miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what I&rsquo;m thinking about. But there&mdash;I&rsquo;d better let you alone!
      What can you do? Only fancy ... there you ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, there, if you please, you hold your tongue,&rsquo; he said quickly,
      seeming to be searching for Onisim with his eyes; &lsquo;I shall really, you
      know ... I ... what do you mean by it, really? You&rsquo;d better help me
      dress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim slowly drew off Ivan Afanasiitch&rsquo;s greasy Tartar dressing-gown,
      gazed with fatherly commiseration at his master, shook his head, put him
      on his coat, and fell to beating him about the back with a brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov went out, and after a not very protracted stroll about the
      crooked streets of the town, found himself facing the baker&rsquo;s shop. A
      queer smile was playing about his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly time to look twice at the too well-known &lsquo;establishment,&rsquo; 
      when suddenly the little gate opened, and Vassilissa ran out with a yellow
      kerchief on her head and a jacket flung after the Russian fashion on her
      shoulders. Ivan Afanasiitch at once overtook her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you going, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa glanced swiftly at him, laughed, turned away, and put her hand
      over her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going shopping, I suppose?&rsquo; queried Ivan Afanasiitch, fidgeting with his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How inquisitive we are!&rsquo; retorted Vassilissa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why inquisitive?&rsquo; said Pyetushkov, hurriedly gesticulating with his
      hands. &lsquo;Quite the contrary.... Oh yes, you know,&rsquo; he added hastily, as
      though these last words completely conveyed his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you eat my roll?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure I did,&rsquo; replied Pyetushkov: &lsquo;with special enjoyment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa continued to walk on and to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s pleasant weather to-day,&rsquo; pursued Ivan Afanasiitch: &lsquo;do you often go
      out walking?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, how I should like....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls in our district utter those words in a very queer way, with a
      peculiar sharpness and rapidity.... Partridges call at sunset with just
      that sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To go out walking, don&rsquo;t you know, with you ... into the country, or ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, upon my word, how you do go on!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But allow me....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point they were overtaken by a dapper little shopman, with a
      little goat&rsquo;s beard, and with his fingers held apart like antlers, so as
      to keep his sleeves from slipping over his hands, in a long-skirted bluish
      coat, and a warm cap that resembled a bloated water-melon. Pyetushkov, for
      propriety&rsquo;s sake, fell back a little behind Vassilissa, but quickly came
      up with her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, what about our walk?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa looked slily at him and giggled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you belong to these parts?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa passed her hand over her hair and walked a little more slowly.
      Ivan Afanasiitch smiled, and, his heart inwardly sinking with timidity, he
      stooped a little on one side and put a trembling arm about the beauty&rsquo;s
      waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa uttered a shriek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give over, do, for shame, in the street.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come now, there, there,&rsquo; muttered Ivan Afanasiitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give over, I tell you, in the street.... Don&rsquo;t be rude.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A ... a ... ah, what a girl you are!&rsquo; said Pyetushkov reproachfully,
      while he blushed up to his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now go along with you, sir&mdash;go along, do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov obeyed. He got home, and sat for a whole hour without moving
      from his chair, without even smoking his pipe. At last he took out a sheet
      of greyish paper, mended a pen, and after long deliberation wrote the
      following letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR MADAM, VASSILISSA TIMOFYEVNA!&mdash;Being naturally a most
      inoffensive person, how could I have occasioned you annoyance? If I have
      really been to blame in my conduct to you, then I must tell you: the hints
      of Mr. Bublitsyn were responsible for this, which was what I never
      expected. Anyway, I must humbly beg you not to be angry with me. I am a
      sensitive man, and any kindness I am most sensible of and grateful for. Do
      not be angry with me, Vassilissa Timofyevna, I beg you most humbly.&mdash;I
      remain respectfully your obedient servant,
    </p>
    <h3>
      IVAN PYETUSHKOV.&rsquo; 
    </h3>
    <p>
      Onisim carried this letter to its address.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      A fortnight passed. Onisim went every morning as usual to the baker&rsquo;s
      shop. One day Vassilissa ran out to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morning, Onisim Sergeitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim put on a gloomy expression, and responded crossly, &lsquo;&rsquo;Morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is it you never come to see us, Onisim Sergeitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim glanced morosely at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What should I come for? you wouldn&rsquo;t give me a cup of tea, no fear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I would, Onisim Sergeitch, I would. You come and see. Rum in it,
      too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim slowly relaxed into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind if I do, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When, then&mdash;when?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When ... well, you are ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-day&mdash;this evening, if you like. Drop in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll come along,&rsquo; replied Onisim, and he sauntered home with
      his slow, rolling step.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same evening in a little room, beside a bed covered with a striped
      eider-down, Onisim was sitting at a clumsy little table, facing
      Vassilissa. A huge, dingy yellow samovar was hissing and bubbling on the
      table; a pot of geranium stood in the window; in the other corner near the
      door there stood aslant an ugly chest with a tiny hanging lock; on the
      chest lay a shapeless heap of all sorts of old rags; on the walls were
      black, greasy prints. Onisim and Vassilissa drank their tea in silence,
      looking straight at each other, turning the lumps of sugar over and over
      in their hands, as it were reluctantly nibbling them, blinking, screwing
      up their eyes, and with a hissing sound sucking in the yellowish boiling
      liquid through their teeth. At last they had emptied the whole samovar,
      turned upside down the round cups&mdash;one with the inscription, &lsquo;Take
      your fill&rsquo;; the other with the words, &lsquo;Cupid&rsquo;s dart hath pierced my heart&rsquo;&mdash;then
      they cleared their throats, wiped their perspiring brows, and gradually
      dropped into conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Onisim Sergeitch, how about your master ...&rsquo; began Vassilissa, and did
      not finish her sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about my master?&rsquo; replied Onisim, and he leaned on his hand. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
      all right. But why do you ask?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I only asked,&rsquo; answered Vassilissa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I say&rsquo;&mdash;(here Onisim grinned)&mdash;&lsquo;I say, he wrote you a
      letter, didn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim shook his head with an extraordinarily self-satisfied air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he did, did he?&rsquo; he said huskily, with a smile. &lsquo;Well, and what did he
      say in his letter to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, all sorts of things. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean anything, Madam, Vassilissa
      Timofyevna,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think anything of it; don&rsquo;t you be
      offended, madam,&rdquo; and a lot more like that he wrote.... But I say,&rsquo; she
      added after a brief silence: &lsquo;what&rsquo;s he like?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; Onisim responded indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he get angry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He get angry! Not he. Why, do you like him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa looked down and giggled in her sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; grumbled Onisim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s that to you, Onisim Sergeitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, come, I tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; Vassilissa brought out at last, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s ... a gentleman. Of course
      ... I ... and besides; he ... you know yourself ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I do,&rsquo; Onisim observed solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you&rsquo;re aware, to be sure, Onisim Sergeitch.&rsquo; ... Vassilissa was
      obviously becoming agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You tell him, your master, that I&rsquo;m ...; say, not angry with him, but
      that ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We understand,&rsquo; responded Onisim, and he got up from his seat. &lsquo;We
      understand. Thanks for the entertainment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in again some day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, all right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim approached the door. The fat woman came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good evening to you, Onisim Sergeitch,&rsquo; she said in a peculiar chant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good evening to you, Praskovia Ivanovna,&rsquo; he said in the same sing-song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both stood still for a little while facing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, good day to you, Praskovia Ivanovna,&rsquo; Onisim chanted out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, good day to you, Onisim Sergeitch,&rsquo; she responded in the same
      sing-song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim arrived home. His master was lying on his bed, gazing at the
      ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where have you been?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where have I been?&rsquo; ... (Onisim had the habit of repeating reproachfully
      the last words of every question.) &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been about your business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What business?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know? ... I&rsquo;ve been to see Vassilissa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov blinked and turned over on his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So that&rsquo;s how it is,&rsquo; observed Onisim, and he coolly took a pinch of
      snuff. &lsquo;So that&rsquo;s how it is. You&rsquo;re always like that. Vassilissa sends you
      her duty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really? So that&rsquo;s all about it. Really! ... She told me to say, Why is
      it, says she, one never sees him? Why is it, says she, he never comes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and what did you say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did I say? I told her: You&rsquo;re a silly girl&mdash;I told her&mdash;as
      if folks like that are coming to see you! No, you come yourself, I told
      her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and what did she say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did she say? ... She said nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is, how do you mean, nothing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, nothing, to be sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov said nothing for a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and is she coming?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She coming! You&rsquo;re in too great a hurry, sir. She coming, indeed! No, you
      go too fast.&rsquo; ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you said yourself that ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, well, it&rsquo;s easy to talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov was silent again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but how&rsquo;s it to be, then, my lad?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How? ... You ought to know best; you &lsquo;re a gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nonsense! come now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim swayed complacently backwards and forwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know Praskovia Ivanovna?&rsquo; he asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. What Praskovia Ivanovna?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the baker woman!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, the baker woman. I&rsquo;ve seen her; she&rsquo;s very fat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a worthy woman. She&rsquo;s own aunt to the other, to your girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aunt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, didn&rsquo;t you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim was restrained by respect for his master from giving full
      expression to his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s whom it is you should make friends with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve no objection.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim looked approvingly at Ivan Afanasiitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But with what object precisely am I to make friends with her?&rsquo; inquired
      Pyetushkov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for, indeed!&rsquo; answered Onisim serenely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch got up, paced up and down the room, stood still before
      the window, and without turning his head, with some hesitation he
      articulated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Onisim!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t it be, you know, a little awkward for me with the old woman, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s as you like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, well, I only thought it might, perhaps. My comrades might notice it;
      it&rsquo;s a little ... But I&rsquo;ll think it over. Give me my pipe.... So she,&rsquo; he
      went on after a short silence&mdash;Vassilissa, I mean, says then ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Onisim had no desire to continue the conversation, and he assumed his
      habitual morose expression.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch&rsquo;s acquaintance with Praskovia Ivanovna began in the
      following manner. Five days after his conversation with Onisim, Pyetushkov
      set off in the evening to the baker&rsquo;s shop. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; thought he, as he
      unlatched the creaking gate, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s to be.&rsquo; ...
    </p>
    <p>
      He mounted the steps, opened the door. A huge, crested hen rushed, with a
      deafening cackle, straight under his feet, and long after was still
      running about the yard in wild excitement. From a room close by peeped the
      astonished countenance of the fat woman. Ivan Afanasiitch smiled and
      nodded. The fat woman bowed to him. Tightly grasping his hat, Pyetushkov
      approached her. Praskovia Ivanovna was apparently anticipating an honoured
      guest; her dress was fastened up at every hook. Pyetushkov sat down on a
      chair; Praskovia Ivanovna seated herself opposite him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come to you, Praskovia Ivanovna, more on account of....&rsquo; Ivan
      Afanasiitch began at last&mdash;and then ceased. His lips were twitching
      spasmodically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are kindly welcome, sir,&rsquo; responded Praskovia Ivanovna in the proper
      sing-song, and with a bow. &lsquo;Always delighted to see a guest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov took courage a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have long wished, you know, to have the pleasure of making your
      acquaintance, Praskovia Ivanovna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Much obliged to you, Ivan Afanasiitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed a silence. Praskovia Ivanovna wiped her face with a
      parti-coloured handkerchief; Ivan Afanasiitch continued with intense
      attention to gaze away to one side. Both were rather uncomfortable. But in
      merchant and petty shopkeeper society, where even old friends never step
      outside special angular forms of etiquette, a certain constraint in the
      behaviour of guests and host to one another not only strikes no one as
      strange, but, on the contrary, is regarded as perfectly correct and
      indispensable, particularly on a first visit. Praskovia Ivanovna was
      agreeably impressed by Pyetushkov. He was formal and decorous in his
      manners, and moreover, wasn&rsquo;t he a man of some rank, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Praskovia Ivanovna, ma&rsquo;am, I like your rolls very much,&rsquo; he said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really now, really now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good they are, you know, very, indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May they do you good, sir, may they do you good. Delighted, to be sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never eaten any like them in Moscow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say so now, you don&rsquo;t say so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again a silence followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me, Praskovia Ivanovna,&rsquo; began Ivan Afanasiitch; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s your niece,
      I fancy, isn&rsquo;t it, living with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My own niece, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How comes it ... she&rsquo;s with you?&rsquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s an orphan, so I keep her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And is she a good worker?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such a girl to work ... such a girl, sir ... ay ... ay ... to be sure she
      is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch thought it discreet not to pursue the subject of the
      niece further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What bird is that you have in the cage, Praskovia Ivanovna?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God knows. A bird of some sort.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;m! Well, so, good day to you, Praskovia Ivanovna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very good day to your honour. Pray walk in another time, and take a cup
      of tea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With the greatest pleasure, Praskovia Ivanovna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov walked out. On the steps he met Vassilissa. She giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you going, my darling?&rsquo; said Pyetushkov with reckless daring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, give over, do, you are a one for joking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He, he! And did you get my letter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa hid the lower part of her face in her sleeve and made no
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you&rsquo;re not angry with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vassilissa!&rsquo; came the jarring voice of the aunt; &lsquo;hey, Vassilissa!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa ran into the house. Pyetushkov returned home. But from that day
      he began going often to the baker&rsquo;s shop, and his visits were not for
      nothing. Ivan Afanasiitch&rsquo;s hopes, to use the lofty phraseology suitable,
      were crowned with success. Usually, the attainment of the goal has a
      cooling effect on people, but Pyetushkov, on the contrary, grew every day
      more and more ardent. Love is a thing of accident, it exists in itself,
      like art, and, like nature, needs no reasons to justify it, as some clever
      man has said who never loved, himself, but made excellent observations
      upon love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov became passionately attached to Vassilissa. He was completely
      happy. His soul was aglow with bliss. Little by little he carried all his
      belongings, at any rate all his pipes, to Praskovia Ivanovna&rsquo;s, and for
      whole days together he sat in her back room. Praskovia Ivanovna charged
      him something for his dinner and drank his tea, consequently she did not
      complain of his presence. Vassilissa had grown used to him. She would
      work, sing, or spin before him, sometimes exchanging a couple of words
      with him; Pyetushkov watched her, smoked his pipe, swayed to and fro in
      his chair, laughed, and in leisure hours played &lsquo;Fools&rsquo; with her and
      Praskovia Ivanovna. Ivan Afanasiitch was happy....
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this world nothing is perfect, and, small as a man&rsquo;s requirements
      may be, destiny never quite fulfils them, and positively spoils the whole
      thing, if possible.... The spoonful of pitch is sure to find its way into
      the barrel of honey! Ivan Afanasiitch experienced this in his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, from the time of his establishing himself at
      Vassilissa&rsquo;s, Pyetushkov dropped more than ever out of all intercourse
      with his comrades. He saw them only when absolutely necessary, and then,
      to avoid allusions and jeers (in which, however, he was not always
      successful), he put on the desperately sullen and intensely scared look of
      a hare in a display of fireworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, Onisim gave him no peace; he had lost every trace of respect for
      him, he mercilessly persecuted him, put him to shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      And ... thirdly.... Alas! read further, kindly reader.

    <h2>
      V
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day Pyetushkov (who for the reasons given above found little comfort
      outside Praskovia Ivanovna&rsquo;s doors) was sitting in Vassilissa&rsquo;s room at
      the back, and was busying himself over some home-brewed concoction,
      something in the way of jam or syrup. The mistress of the house was not at
      home. Vassilissa was sitting in the shop singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a knock at the little pane. Vassilissa got up, went to the
      window, uttered a little shriek, giggled, and began whispering with some
      one. On going back to her place, she sighed, and then fell to singing
      louder than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who was that you were talking to?&rsquo; Pyetushkov asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa went on singing carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vassilissa, do you hear? Vassilissa!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whom were you talking to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only asked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov came out of the back room in a parti-coloured smoking-jacket
      with tucked-up sleeves, and a strainer in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, a friend of mine,&rsquo; answered Vassilissa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What friend?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Piotr Petrovitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Piotr Petrovitch? ... what Piotr Petrovitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s one of your lot. He&rsquo;s got such a difficult name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bublitsyn?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes ... Piotr Petrovitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do you know him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rather!&rsquo; responded Vassilissa, with a wag of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov, without a word, paced ten times up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say, Vassilissa,&rsquo; he said at last, &lsquo;that is, how do you know him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do I know him? ... I know him ... He&rsquo;s such a nice gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you mean nice, though? how nice? how nice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa gazed at Ivan Afanasiitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nice,&rsquo; she said slowly and in perplexity. &lsquo;You know what I mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov bit his lips and began again pacing the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What were you talking about with him, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa smiled and looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak, speak, speak, I tell you, speak!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How cross you are to-day!&rsquo; observed Vassilissa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come now, Vassilissa,&rsquo; he began at last; &lsquo;no, I won&rsquo;t be cross.... Come,
      tell me, what were you talking about?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a one to joke, really, that Piotr Petrovitch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what did he say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a fellow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov was silent again for a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vassilissa, you love me, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; he asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re after, too!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Pyetushkov felt a pang at his heart. Praskovia Ivanovna came in. They
      sat down to dinner. After dinner Praskovia Ivanovna betook herself to the
      shelf bed. Ivan Afanasiitch himself lay down on the stove, turned over and
      dropped asleep. A cautious creak waked him. Ivan Afanasiitch sat up,
      leaned on his elbow, looked: the door was open. He jumped up&mdash;no
      Vassilissa. He ran into the yard&mdash;she was not in the yard; into the
      street, looked up and down&mdash;Vassilissa was nowhere to be seen. He ran
      without his cap as far as the market&mdash;no, Vassilissa was not in
      sight. Slowly he returned to the baker&rsquo;s shop, clambered on to the stove,
      and turned with his face to the wall. He felt miserable. Bublitsyn ...
      Bublitsyn ... the name was positively ringing in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my good sir?&rsquo; Praskovia Ivanovna asked him in a drowsy
      voice. &lsquo;Why are you groaning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nothing, ma&rsquo;am. Nothing. I feel a weight oppressing me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the mushrooms,&rsquo; murmured Praskovia Ivanovna&mdash;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s all those
      mushrooms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      O Lord, have mercy on us sinners!
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed, a second&mdash;still no Vassilissa. Twenty times
      Pyetushkov was on the point of getting up, and twenty times he huddled
      miserably under the sheepskin.... At last he really did get down from the
      stove and determined to go home, and positively went out into the yard,
      but came back. Praskovia Ivanovna got up. The hired man, Luka, black as a
      beetle, though he was a baker, put the bread into the oven. Pyetushkov
      went again out on to the steps and pondered. The goat that lived in the
      yard went up to him, and gave him a little friendly poke with his horns.
      Pyetushkov looked at him, and for some unknown reason said &lsquo;Kss, Kss.&rsquo; 
      Suddenly the low wicket-gate slowly opened and Vassilissa appeared. Ivan
      Afanasiitch went straight to meet her, took her by the hand, and rather
      coolly, but resolutely, said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come along with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, excuse me, Ivan Afanasiitch ... I ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come with me,&rsquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov led her to his lodgings. Onisim, as usual, was lying at full
      length asleep. Ivan Afanasiitch waked him, told him to light a candle.
      Vassilissa went to the window and sat down in silence. While Onisim was
      busy getting a light in the anteroom, Pyetushkov stood motionless at the
      other window, staring into the street. Onisim came in, with the candle in
      his hands, was beginning to grumble ... Ivan Afanasiitch turned quickly
      round: &lsquo;Go along,&rsquo; he said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim stood still in the middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go away at once,&rsquo; Pyetushkov repeated threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim looked at his master and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch shouted after him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Away, quite away. Out of the house. You can come back in two hours&rsquo; 
      time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim slouched off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov waited till he heard the gate bang, and at once went up to
      Vassilissa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where have you been?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa was confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where have you been? I tell you,&rsquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa looked round ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am speaking to you ... where have you been?&rsquo; And Pyetushkov raised his
      arm ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t beat me, Ivan Afanasiitch, don&rsquo;t beat me,&rsquo; Vassilissa whispered in
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beat you ... No! I&rsquo;m not going to beat you. Beat you? I beg your pardon,
      my darling. God bless you! While I supposed you loved me, while I ... I
      ... &lsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch broke off. He gasped for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen, Vassilissa,&rsquo; he said at last. &lsquo;You know I&rsquo;m a kind-hearted man,
      you know it, don&rsquo;t you, Vassilissa, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I do,&rsquo; she said faltering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do nobody any harm, nobody, nobody in the world. And I deceive nobody.
      Why are you deceiving me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m not deceiving you, Ivan Afanasiitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You aren&rsquo;t deceiving me? Oh, very well! Oh, very well! Then tell me where
      you&rsquo;ve been.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I went to see Matrona.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a lie!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, I&rsquo;ve been at Matrona&rsquo;s. You ask her, if you don&rsquo;t believe me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Bub&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name ... have you seen that devil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I did see him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did see him! you did see him! Oh! you did see him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you were making an appointment with him in the morning at the window&mdash;eh?
      eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He asked me to come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so you went.... Thanks very much, my girl, thanks very much!&rsquo; 
      Pyetushkov made Vassilissa a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Ivan Afanasiitch, you&rsquo;re maybe fancying ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better not talk to me! And a pretty fool I am! There&rsquo;s nothing to
      make an outcry for! You may make friends with any one you like. I&rsquo;ve
      nothing to do with you. So there! I don&rsquo;t want to know you even.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s for you to say, Ivan Afanasiitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you yourself ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not sending you away,&rsquo; Pyetushkov interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no, Ivan Afanasiitch.... What&rsquo;s the use of my stopping here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov let her get as far as the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you&rsquo;re going, Vassilissa?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You keep on abusing me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I abuse you! You&rsquo;ve no fear of God, Vassilissa! When have I abused you?
      Come, come, say when?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why! Just this minute weren&rsquo;t you all but beating me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vassilissa, it&rsquo;s wicked of you. Really, it&rsquo;s downright wicked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then you threw it in my face, that you don&rsquo;t want to know me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
      gentleman,&rdquo; say you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch began wringing his hands speechlessly. Vassilissa got
      back as far as the middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, God be with you, Ivan Afanasiitch. I&rsquo;ll keep myself to myself, and
      you keep yourself to yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense, Vassilissa, nonsense,&rsquo; Pyetushkov cut her short. &lsquo;You think
      again; look at me. You see I&rsquo;m not myself. You see I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m
      saying.... You might have some feeling for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You keep on abusing me, Ivan Afanasiitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Vassilissa! Let bygones be bygones. Isn&rsquo;t that right? Come, you&rsquo;re
      not angry with me, are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You keep abusing me,&rsquo; Vassilissa repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t, my love, I won&rsquo;t. Forgive an old man like me. I&rsquo;ll never do it
      in future. Come, you&rsquo;ve forgiven me, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God be with you, Ivan Afanasiitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, laugh then, laugh.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You laughed, you laughed, my love!&rsquo; cried Pyetushkov, and he capered
      about like a child.

    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day Pyetushkov went to the baker&rsquo;s shop as usual. Everything went
      on as before. But there was a settled ache at his heart. He did not laugh
      now as often, and sometimes he fell to musing. Sunday came. Praskovia
      Ivanovna had an attack of lumbago; she did not get down from the shelf
      bed, except with much difficulty to go to mass. After mass Pyetushkov
      called Vassilissa into the back room. She had been complaining all the
      morning of feeling dull. To judge by the expression of Ivan Afanasiitch&rsquo;s
      countenance, he was revolving in his brain some extraordinary idea,
      unforeseen even by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You sit down here, Vassilissa,&rsquo; he said to her, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll sit here. I
      want to have a little talk with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me, Vassilissa, can you write?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Write?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, write?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about reading?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t read either.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then who read you my letter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The deacon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But would you like to learn to read and write?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what use would reading and writing be to us, Ivan Afanasiitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What use? You could read books.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what good is there in books?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All sorts of good ... I tell you what, if you like, I&rsquo;ll bring you a
      book.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I can&rsquo;t read, you see, Ivan Afanasiitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll read to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, I say, won&rsquo;t it be dull?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense! dull! On the contrary, it&rsquo;s the best thing to get rid of
      dulness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll read stories, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall see to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening Pyetushkov returned home, and began rummaging in his boxes.
      He found several odd numbers of the Library of Good Reading, five grey
      Moscow novels, Nazarov&rsquo;s arithmetic, a child&rsquo;s geography with a globe on
      the title-page, the second part of Keydanov&rsquo;s history, two dream-books, an
      almanack for the year 1819, two numbers of Galatea, Kozlov&rsquo;s <i>Natalia
      Dolgorukaia</i>, and the first part of <i>Roslavlev</i>. He pondered a
      long while which to choose, and finally made up his mind to take Kozlov&rsquo;s
      poem, and <i>Roslavlev</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day Pyetushkov dressed in haste, put both the books under the lapel
      of his coat, went to the baker&rsquo;s shop, and began reading aloud Zagoskin&rsquo;s
      novel. Vassilissa sat without moving; at first she smiled, then seemed to
      become absorbed in thought ... then she bent a little forward; her eyes
      closed, her mouth slightly opened, her hands fell on her knees; she was
      dozing. Pyetushkov read quickly, inarticulately, in a thick voice; he
      raised his eyes ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vassilissa, are you asleep?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, rubbed her face, and stretched. Pyetushkov felt angry with
      her and with himself....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s dull,&rsquo; said Vassilissa lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you what, would you like me to read you poetry?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poetry ... good poetry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that&rsquo;s enough, really.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov hurriedly picked up Kozlov&rsquo;s poem, jumped up, crossed the room,
      ran impulsively up to Vassilissa, and began reading. Vassilissa let her
      head drop backwards, spread out her hands, stared into Ivan Afanasiitch&rsquo;s
      face, and suddenly went off into a loud harsh guffaw ... she fairly rolled
      about with laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch flung the book on the floor in his annoyance. Vassilissa
      went on laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what are you laughing at, silly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa roared more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Laugh away, laugh away,&rsquo; Pyetushkov muttered between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa held her sides, gasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what is it, idiot?&rsquo; But Vassilissa could only wave her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch snatched up his cap, and ran out of the house. With
      rapid, unsteady steps, he walked about the town, walked on and on, and
      found himself at the city gates. Suddenly there was the rattle of wheels,
      the tramp of horses along the street.... Some one called him by name. He
      raised his head and saw a big, old-fashioned wagonette. In the wagonette
      facing him sat Mr. Bublitsyn between two young ladies, the daughters of
      Mr. Tiutiurov. Both the girls were dressed exactly alike, as though in
      outward sign of their immutable affection; both smiled pensively, and
      carried their heads on one side with a languid grace. On the other side of
      the carriage appeared the wide straw hat of their excellent papa; and from
      time to time his round, plump neck presented itself to the gaze of
      spectators. Beside his straw hat rose the mob-cap of his spouse. The very
      attitude of both the parents was a sufficient proof of their sincere
      goodwill towards the young man and their confidence in him. And Bublitsyn
      obviously was aware of their flattering confidence and appreciated it. He
      was, of course, sitting in an unconstrained position, and talking and
      laughing without constraint; but in the very freedom of his manner there
      could be discerned a shade of tender, touching respectfulness. And the
      Tiutiurov girls? It is hard to convey in words all that an attentive
      observer could trace in the faces of the two sisters. Goodwill and
      gentleness, and discreet gaiety, a melancholy comprehension of life, and a
      faith, not to be shaken, in themselves, in the lofty and noble destiny of
      man on earth, courteous attention to their young companion, in
      intellectual endowments perhaps not fully their equal, but still by the
      qualities of his heart quite deserving of their indulgence ... such were
      the characteristics and the feelings reflected at that moment on the faces
      of the young ladies. Bublitsyn called to Ivan Afanasiitch for no special
      reason, simply in the fulness of his inner satisfaction; he bowed to him
      with excessive friendliness and cordiality. The young ladies even looked
      at him with gentle amiability, as at a man whose acquaintance they would
      not object to.... The good, sleek, quiet horses went by Ivan Afanasiitch
      at a gentle trot; the carriage rolled smoothly along the broad road,
      carrying with it good-humoured, girlish laughter; he caught a final
      glimpse of Mr. Tiutiurov&rsquo;s hat; the two outer horses turned their heads on
      each side, jauntily stepping over the short, green grass ... the coachman
      gave a whistle of approbation and warning, the carriage disappeared behind
      some willows.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long while poor Pyetushkov remained standing still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a poor lonely creature,&rsquo; he whispered at last ... &lsquo;alone in the
      world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A little boy in tatters stopped before him, looked timidly at him, held
      out his hand ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For Christ&rsquo;s sake, good gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov pulled out a copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For your loneliness, poor orphan,&rsquo; he said with effort, and he walked
      back to the baker&rsquo;s shop. On the threshold of Vassilissa&rsquo;s room Ivan
      Afanasiitch stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;these are my friends. Here is my family, this is
      it.... And here Bublitsyn and there Bublitsyn.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa was sitting with her back to him, winding worsted, and
      carelessly singing to herself; she was wearing a striped cotton gown; her
      hair was done up anyhow.... The room, insufferably hot, smelt of feather
      beds and old rags; jaunty, reddish-brown &lsquo;Prussians&rsquo; scurried rapidly here
      and there across the walls; on the decrepit chest of drawers, with holes
      in it where the locks should have been, beside a broken jar, lay a woman&rsquo;s
      shabby slipper.... Kozlov&rsquo;s poem was still where it had fallen on the
      floor.... Pyetushkov shook his head, folded his arms, and went away. He
      was hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home he called for his things to dress. Onisim slouched off after his
      better coat. Pyetushkov had a great desire to draw Onisim into
      conversation, but Onisim preserved a sullen silence. At last Ivan
      Afanasiitch could hold out no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask me where I&rsquo;m going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what do I want to know where you&rsquo;re going for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for? Why, suppose some one comes on urgent business, and asks,
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ivan Afanasiitch?&rdquo; And then you can tell him, &ldquo;Ivan Afanasiitch
      has gone here or there.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Urgent business.... But who ever does come to you on urgent business?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, are you beginning to be rude again? Again, hey?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim turned away, and fell to brushing the coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, Onisim, you are a most disagreeable person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim looked up from under his brows at his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you &lsquo;re always like this. Yes, positively always.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what&rsquo;s the good of my asking you where you&rsquo;re going, Ivan
      Afanasiitch? As though I didn&rsquo;t know! To the girl at the baker&rsquo;s shop!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, that&rsquo;s just where you&rsquo;re wrong! that&rsquo;s just where you&rsquo;re mistaken!
      Not to her at all. I don&rsquo;t intend going to see the girl at the baker&rsquo;s
      shop any more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim dropped his eyelids and brandished the brush. Pyetushkov waited for
      his approbation; but his servant remained speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not the proper thing,&rsquo; Pyetushkov went on in a severe voice&mdash;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s
      unseemly.... Come, tell me what you think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What am I to think? It&rsquo;s for you to say. What business have I to think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov put on his coat. &lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t believe me, the beast,&rsquo; he thought
      to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out of the house, but he did not go to see any one. He walked
      about the streets. He directed his attention to the sunset. At last a
      little after eight o&rsquo;clock he returned home. He wore a smile; he
      repeatedly shrugged his shoulders, as though marvelling at his own folly.
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;this is what comes of a strong will....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day Pyetushkov got up rather late. He had not passed a very good
      night, did not go out all day, and was fearfully bored. Pyetushkov read
      through all his poor books, and praised aloud one story in the Library of
      Good Reading. As he went to bed, he told Onisim to give him his pipe.
      Onisim handed him a wretched pipe. Pyetushkov began smoking; the pipe
      wheezed like a broken-winded horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How disgusting!&rsquo; cried Ivan Afanasiitch; &lsquo;where&rsquo;s my cherry wood pipe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the baker&rsquo;s shop,&rsquo; Onisim responded tranquilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov blinked spasmodically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you wish me to go for it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you needn&rsquo;t; don&rsquo;t go ... no need, don&rsquo;t go, do you hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The night passed somehow. In the morning Onisim, as usual, gave Pyetushkov
      on the blue sprigged plate a new white roll. Ivan Afanasiitch looked out
      of window and asked Onisim:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been to the baker&rsquo;s shop?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s to go, if I don&rsquo;t?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov became plunged in meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me, please, did you see any one there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whom did you see there, now, for instance?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, of course, Vassilissa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch was silent. Onisim cleared the table, and was just going
      out of the room....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Onisim,&rsquo; Pyetushkov cried faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Er ... did she ask after me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course she didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov set his teeth. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s worth, her
      love, indeed....&rsquo; His head dropped. &lsquo;Absurd I was, to be sure,&rsquo; he thought
      again. &lsquo;A fine idea to read her poetry. A girl like that! Why, she&rsquo;s a
      fool! Why, she&rsquo;s good for nothing but to lie on the stove and eat
      pancakes. Why, she&rsquo;s a post, a perfect post; an uneducated workgirl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s never come,&rsquo; he whispered, two hours later, still sitting in the
      same place, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s never come. To think of it; why, she could see that I
      left her out of temper; why, she might know that I was hurt. There&rsquo;s love
      for you! And she did not even ask if I were well. Never even said, &ldquo;Is
      Ivan Afanasiitch quite well?&rdquo; She hasn&rsquo;t seen me for two whole days&mdash;and
      not a sign.... She&rsquo;s even again, maybe, thought fit to meet that Bub&mdash;Lucky
      fellow. Ouf, devil take it, what a fool I am!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov got up, paced up and down the room in silence, stood still,
      knitted his brows slightly and scratched his neck. &lsquo;However,&rsquo; he said
      aloud, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go to see her. I must see what she&rsquo;s about there. I must make
      her feel ashamed. Most certainly ... I&rsquo;ll go. Onisim! my clothes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he mused as he dressed, &lsquo;we shall see what comes of it. She may, I
      dare say, be angry with me. And after all, a man keeps coming and coming,
      and all of a sudden, for no rhyme or reason, goes and gives up coming.
      Well, we shall see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch went out of the house, and made his way to the baker&rsquo;s
      shop. He stopped at the little gate, he wanted to straighten himself out
      and set himself to rights.... Pyetushkov clutched at the folds of his coat
      with both hands, and almost pulled them out altogether.... Convulsively he
      twisted his tightly compressed neck, fastened the top hook of his collar,
      drew a deep breath....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why are you standing there?&rsquo; Praskovia Ivanovna bawled to him from the
      little window. &lsquo;Come in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov started, and went in. Praskovia Ivanovna met him in the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come to see us yesterday, my good sir? Was it, maybe, some
      ailment prevented you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I had something of a headache yesterday....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you should have put cucumber on your temples, my good sir. It would
      have taken it away in a twinkling. Is your head aching now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah well, and thank Thee, O Lord, for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch went off into the back room. Vassilissa saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! good day, Ivan Afanasiitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good day, Vassilissa Ivanovna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where have you put the tap, Ivan Afanasiitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tap? what tap?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wine-tap ... our tap. You must have taken it home with you. You are
      such a one ... Lord, forgive us....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov put on a dignified and chilly air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will direct my man to look. Seeing that I was not here yesterday,&rsquo; he
      pronounced significantly....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, why, to be sure, you weren&rsquo;t here yesterday.&rsquo; Vassilissa squatted
      down on her heels, and began rummaging in the chest....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aunt, hi! aunt!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sa-ay?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you taken my neckerchief?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What neckerchief?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the yellow one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The yellow one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, the yellow, figured one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ve not taken it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov bent down to Vassilissa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen to me, Vassilissa; listen to what I am saying to you. It is not a
      matter of taps or of neckerchiefs just now; you can attend to such trifles
      another time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa did not budge from her position; she only lifted her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You just tell me, on your conscience, do you love me or not? That&rsquo;s what
      I want to know, once for all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, what a one you are, Ivan Afanasiitch.... Well, then, of course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you love me, how was it you didn&rsquo;t come to see me yesterday? Had you
      no time? Well, you might have sent to find out if I were ill, as I didn&rsquo;t
      turn up. But it&rsquo;s little you cared. I might die, I dare say, you wouldn&rsquo;t
      grieve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Ivan Afanasiitch, one can&rsquo;t be always thinking of one thing, one&rsquo;s
      got one&rsquo;s work to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; responded Pyetushkov; &lsquo;but all the same ... And it&rsquo;s
      improper to laugh at your elders.... It&rsquo;s not right. Moreover, it&rsquo;s as
      well in certain cases ... But where&rsquo;s my pipe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s your pipe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov began smoking.
    </p>

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Several days slipped by again, apparently rather tranquilly. But a storm
      was getting nearer. Pyetushkov suffered tortures, was jealous, never took
      his eyes off Vassilissa, kept an alarmed watch over her, annoyed her
      horribly. Behold, one evening, Vassilissa dressed herself with more care
      than usual, and, seizing a favourable instant, sallied off to make a visit
      somewhere. Night came on, she had not returned. Pyetushkov at sunset went
      home to his lodgings, and at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning ran to the
      baker&rsquo;s shop.... Vassilissa had not come in. With an inexpressible sinking
      at his heart, he waited for her right up to dinner-time.... They sat down
      to the table without her....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever can have become of her?&rsquo; Praskovia Ivanovna observed
      serenely....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You spoil her, you simply spoil her utterly!&rsquo; Pyetushkov repeated, in
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh! my good sir, there&rsquo;s no looking after a girl!&rsquo; responded Praskovia
      Ivanovna. &lsquo;Let her go her way! So long as she does her work.... Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t folks enjoy themselves? ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A cold shudder ran over Pyetushkov. At last, towards evening, Vassilissa
      made her appearance. This was all he was waiting for. Majestically
      Pyetushkov rose from his seat, folded his arms, scowled menacingly.... But
      Vassilissa looked him boldly in the face, laughed impudently, and before
      he could utter a single word she went quickly into her own room, and
      locked herself in. Ivan Afanasiitch opened his mouth, looked in amazement
      at Praskovia Ivanovna.... Praskovia Ivanovna cast down her eyes. Ivan
      Afanasiitch stood still a moment, groped after his cap, put it on askew,
      and went out without closing his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached home, took up a leather cushion, and with it flung himself on
      the sofa, with his face to the wall. Onisim looked in out of the passage,
      went into the room, leaned his back against the door, took a pinch of
      snuff, and crossed his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you unwell, Ivan Afanasiitch?&rsquo; he asked Pyetushkov.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I go for the doctor?&rsquo; Onisim continued, after a brief pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite well.... Go away,&rsquo; Ivan Afanasiitch articulated huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well? ... no, you&rsquo;re not well, Ivan Afanasiitch.... Is this what you call
      being well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just look at yourself. You&rsquo;ve grown so thin, that you&rsquo;re simply not like
      yourself. And what&rsquo;s it all about? It&rsquo;s enough to turn one&rsquo;s brain to
      think of it. And you a gentleman born, too!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim paused. Pyetushkov did not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that the way gentlemen go on? They&rsquo;d amuse themselves a bit, to be
      sure ... why shouldn&rsquo;t they ... they&rsquo;d amuse themselves, and then drop
      it.... They may well say, Fall in love with Old Nick, and you&rsquo;ll think him
      a beauty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch merely writhed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s really like this, Ivan Afanasiitch. If any one had said this
      and that of you, and your goings on, why, I would have said, &ldquo;Get along
      with you, you fool, what do you take me for?&rdquo; Do you suppose I&rsquo;d have
      believed it? Why, as it is, I see it with my own eyes, and I can&rsquo;t believe
      it. Worse than this nothing can be. Has she put some spell over you or
      what? Why, what is there in her? If you come to consider, she&rsquo;s below
      contempt, really. She can&rsquo;t even speak as she ought.... She&rsquo;s simply a
      baggage! Worse, even!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go away,&rsquo; Ivan Afanasiitch moaned into the cushion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going away, Ivan Afanasiitch. Who&rsquo;s to speak, if I don&rsquo;t?
      Why, upon my word! Here, you &lsquo;re breaking your heart now ... and over
      what? Eh, over what? tell me that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, go away, Onisim,&rsquo; Pyetushkov moaned again. Onisim, for propriety&rsquo;s
      sake, was silent for a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And another thing,&rsquo; he began again, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s no feeling of gratitude
      whatever. Any other girl wouldn&rsquo;t know how to do enough to please you;
      while she! ... she doesn&rsquo;t even think of you. Why, it&rsquo;s simply a disgrace.
      Why, the things people are saying about you, one cannot repeat them, they
      positively cry shame on me. If I could have known beforehand, I&rsquo;d
      have....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, go away, do, devil!&rsquo; shrieked Pyetushkov, not stirring from his
      place, however, nor raising his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ivan Afanasiitch, for mercy&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; pursued the ruthless Onisim. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      speaking for your good. Despise her, Ivan Afanasiitch; you simply break it
      off. Listen to me, or else I&rsquo;ll fetch a wise woman; she&rsquo;ll break the spell
      in no time. You&rsquo;ll laugh at it yourself, later on; you&rsquo;ll say to me,
      &ldquo;Onisim, why, it&rsquo;s marvellous how such things happen sometimes!&rdquo; You just
      consider yourself: girls like her, they&rsquo;re like dogs ... you&rsquo;ve only to
      whistle to them....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Like one frantic, Pyetushkov jumped up from the sofa ... but, to the
      amazement of Onisim, who was already lifting both hands to the level of
      his cheeks, he sat down again, as though some one had cut away his legs
      from under him.... Tears were rolling down his pale face, a tuft of hair
      stood up straight on the top of his head, his eyes looked dimmed ... his
      drawn lips were quivering ... his head sank on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim looked at Pyetushkov and plumped heavily down on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear master, Ivan Afanasiitch,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;your honour! Be pleased to
      punish me. I&rsquo;m a fool. I&rsquo;ve troubled you, Ivan Afanasiitch.... How did I
      dare! Be pleased to punish me, your honour.... It&rsquo;s not worth your while
      to weep over my silly words ... dear master. Ivan Afanasiitch....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pyetushkov did not even look at his servant; he turned away and buried
      himself in the corner of the sofa again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim got up, went up to his master, stood over him, and twice he tugged
      at his own hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to undress, sir ... you should go to bed ... you should
      take some raspberry tea ... don&rsquo;t grieve, please your honour.... It&rsquo;s only
      half a trouble, it&rsquo;s all nothing ... it&rsquo;ll be all right in the end,&rsquo; he
      said to him every two minutes....
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pyetushkov did not get up from the sofa, and only twitched his
      shoulders now and then, and drew up his knees to his stomach....
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim did not leave his side all night. Towards morning Pyetushkov fell
      asleep, but he did not sleep long. At seven o&rsquo;clock he got up from the
      sofa, pale, dishevelled, and exhausted, and asked for tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim with amazing eagerness and speed brought the samovar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ivan Afanasiitch,&rsquo; he began at last, in a timid voice, &lsquo;your honour is
      not angry with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should I be angry with you, Onisim?&rsquo; answered poor Pyetushkov. &lsquo;You
      were perfectly right yesterday, and I quite agreed with you in
      everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only spoke through my devotion to you, Ivan Afanasiitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov was silent and hung his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim saw that things were in a bad way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ivan Afanasiitch,&rsquo; he said suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you like me to fetch Vassilissa here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov flushed red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Onisim, I don&rsquo;t wish it. (&lsquo;Yes, indeed! as if she would come!&rsquo; he
      thought to himself.) One must be firm. It is all nonsense. Yesterday, I
      ... It&rsquo;s a disgrace. You are right. One must cut it all short, once for
      all, as they say. Isn&rsquo;t that true?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the gospel truth your honour speaks, Ivan Afanasiitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov sank again into reverie. He wondered at himself, he did not
      seem to know himself. He sat without stirring and stared at the floor.
      Thoughts whirled round within him, like smoke or fog, while his heart felt
      empty and heavy at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what&rsquo;s the meaning of it, after all,&rsquo; he thought sometimes, and again
      he grew calmer. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nonsense, silliness!&rsquo; he said aloud, and passed his
      hand over his face, shook himself, and his hand dropped again on his knee,
      his eyes again rested on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intently and mournfully Onisim kept watch on his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov lifted his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me, Onisim,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;is it true, are there really such witches&rsquo; 
      spells?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are, to be sure there are,&rsquo; answered Onisim, as he thrust one foot
      forward. &lsquo;Does your honour know the non-commissioned officer, Krupovaty?
      ... His brother was ruined by witchcraft. He was bewitched to love an old
      woman, a cook, if your honour only can explain that! They gave him nothing
      but a morsel of rye bread, with a muttered spell, of course. And
      Krupovaty&rsquo;s brother simply lost his heart to the cook, he fairly ran after
      the cook, he positively adored her&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t keep his eyes off her.
      She might tell him to do anything, he&rsquo;d obey her on the spot. She&rsquo;d even
      make a joke of him before other people, before strangers. Well, she drove
      him into a decline, at last. And so it was Krupovaty&rsquo;s brother died. And
      you know, she was a cook, and an old woman too, very old. (Onisim took a
      pinch of snuff.) Confound the lot of them, these girls and women-folk!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She doesn&rsquo;t care for me a bit, that&rsquo;s clear, at last; that&rsquo;s beyond all
      doubt, at last,&rsquo; Pyetushkov muttered in an undertone, gesticulating with
      his head and hands as though he were explaining to a perfectly extraneous
      person some perfectly extraneous fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Onisim resumed, &lsquo;there are women like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are,&rsquo; listlessly repeated Pyetushkov, in a tone half questioning,
      half perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim looked intently at his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ivan Afanasiitch,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t you have a snack of something?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I have a snack of something?&rsquo; repeated Pyetushkov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or may be you&rsquo;d like to have a pipe?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To have a pipe?&rsquo; repeated Pyetushkov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So this is what it&rsquo;s coming to,&rsquo; muttered Onisim. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s gone deep, it
      seems.&rsquo;

    </h2>
    <p>
      The creak of boots resounded in the passage, and then there was heard the
      usual suppressed cough which announces the presence of a person of
      subordinate position. Onisim went out and promptly came back, accompanied
      by a diminutive soldier with a little, old woman&rsquo;s face, in a patched
      cloak yellow with age, and wearing neither breeches nor cravat. Pyetushkov
      was startled; while the soldier drew himself up, wished him good day, and
      handed him a large envelope bearing the government seal. In this envelope
      was a note from the major in command of the garrison: he called upon
      Pyetushkov to come to him without fail or delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov turned the note over in his hands, and could not refrain from
      asking the messenger, did he know why the major desired his presence,
      though he was very well aware of the utter futility of his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We cannot tell!&rsquo; the soldier cried, with great effort, yet hardly
      audibly, as though he were half asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t he summoning the other officers?&rsquo; Pyetushkov pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We cannot tell,&rsquo; the soldier cried a second time, in just the same voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, you can go,&rsquo; pronounced Pyetushkov.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier wheeled round to the left, scraping his foot as he did so, and
      slapping himself below the spine (this was considered smart in the
      twenties), withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov exchanged glances with Onisim, who at once assumed a look of
      anxiety. Without a word Ivan Afanasiitch set off to the major&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major was a man of sixty, corpulent and clumsily built, with a red and
      bloated face, a short neck, and a continual trembling in his fingers,
      resulting from excessive indulgence in strong drink. He belonged to the
      class of so-called &lsquo;bourbons,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s to say, soldiers risen from the
      ranks; had learned to read at thirty, and spoke with difficulty, partly
      from shortness of breath, partly from inability to follow his own thought.
      His temperament exhibited all the varieties known to science: in the
      morning, before drinking, he was melancholy; in the middle of the day,
      choleric; and in the evening, phlegmatic, that is to say, he did nothing
      at that time but snore and grunt till he was put to bed. Ivan Afanasiitch
      appeared before him during the choleric period. He found him sitting on a
      sofa, in an open dressing-gown, with a pipe between his teeth. A fat,
      crop-eared cat had taken up her position beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha! he&rsquo;s come!&rsquo; growled the major, casting a sidelong glance out of his
      pewtery eyes upon Pyetushkov, and not stirring from his place. &lsquo;Sit down.
      Well, I&rsquo;m going to give you a talking to. I&rsquo;ve wanted to get hold of you
      this long while.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov sank into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For,&rsquo; the major began, with an unexpected lurch of his whole body,
      &lsquo;you&rsquo;re an officer, d&rsquo;ye see, and so you&rsquo;ve got to behave yourself
      according to rule. If you&rsquo;d been a soldier, I&rsquo;d have flogged you, and
      that&rsquo;s all about it, but, as &lsquo;tis, you&rsquo;re an officer. Did any one ever see
      the like of it? Disgracing yourself&mdash;is that a nice thing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Allow me to know to what these remarks may refer?&rsquo; Pyetushkov was
      beginning....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have no arguing! I dislike that beyond everything. I&rsquo;ve said: I
      dislike it; and that&rsquo;s all about it! Ugh&mdash;why, your hooks are not in
      good form even;&mdash;what a disgrace! He sits, day in and day out, at the
      baker&rsquo;s shop; and he a gentleman born! There&rsquo;s a petticoat to be found
      there&mdash;and so there he sits. Let her go to the devil, the petticoat!
      Why, they do say he puts the bread in the oven. It&rsquo;s a stain on the
      uniform ... so it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Allow me to submit,&rsquo; articulated Pyetushkov with a cold chill at his
      heart, &lsquo;that all this, as far as I can make out, refers to my private
      life, so to say....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No arguing with me, I tell you! Private life, he protests, too! If it had
      been a matter of the service I&rsquo;d have sent you straight to the guard-room!
      Alley, marsheer! Because of the oath. Why, there was a whole birch copse,
      maybe, used upon my back, so I should think I know the service; every rule
      of discipline I&rsquo;m very well up in. And I&rsquo;d have you to understand, I say
      this just for the honour of the uniform. You&rsquo;re disgracing the uniform ...
      so you are. I say this like a father ... yes. Because all that&rsquo;s put in my
      charge. I&rsquo;ve to answer for it. And you dare to argue too!&rsquo; the major
      shrieked with sudden fury, and his face turned purple, and he foamed at
      the mouth, while the cat put its tail in the air and jumped down to the
      ground. &lsquo;Why, do you know ... why, do you know what I can do? ... I can do
      anything, anything, anything! Why, do you know whom you&rsquo;re talking to?
      Your superior officer gives you orders and you argue! Your superior
      officer ... your superior officer....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the major positively choked and spluttered, while poor Pyetushkov
      could only draw himself up and turn pale, sitting on the very edge of his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must have&rsquo; ... the major continued, with an imperious wave of his
      trembling hand, &lsquo;I must have everything ... up to the mark! Conduct
      first-class! I&rsquo;m not going to put up with any irregularities! You can make
      friends with whom you like, that makes no odds to me! But if you are a
      gentleman, why, act as such ... behave like one! No putting bread in the
      oven for me! No calling a draggletail old woman auntie! No disgracing the
      uniform! Silence! No arguing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The major&rsquo;s voice broke. He took breath, and turning towards the door into
      the passage, bawled, &lsquo;Frolka, you scoundrel! The herrings!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov rose hurriedly and darted away, almost upsetting the page-boy,
      who ran to meet him, carrying some sliced herring and a stout decanter of
      spirits on an iron tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence! No arguing!&rsquo; sounded after Pyetushkov the disjointed
      exclamations of his exasperated superior officer.

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      A queer sensation overmastered Ivan Afanasiitch when, at last, he found
      himself in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why am I walking as it were in a dream?&rsquo; he thought to himself. &lsquo;Am I out
      of my mind, or what? Why, it passes all belief, at last. Come, damn it,
      she&rsquo;s tired of me, come, and I&rsquo;ve grown tired of her, come, and ... What
      is there out of the way in that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must put an end to it, once for all,&rsquo; he said almost aloud. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go
      and speak out decisively for the last time, so that it may never come up
      again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov made his way with rapid step to the baker&rsquo;s shop. The nephew of
      the hired man, Luka, a little boy, friend and confidant of the goat that
      lived in the yard, darted swiftly to the little gate, directly he caught
      sight of Ivan Afanasiitch in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Praskovia Ivanovna came out to meet Pyetushkov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is your niece at home?&rsquo; asked Pyetushkov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov was inwardly relieved at Vassilissa&rsquo;s absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came to have a few words with you, Praskovia Ivanovna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about, my good sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. You comprehend that after all ... that has passed ...
      after such, so to say, behaviour (Pyetushkov was a little confused) ... in
      a word ... But, pray, don&rsquo;t be angry with me, though.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the contrary, enter into my position, Praskovia Ivanovna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a reasonable woman, you&rsquo;ll understand of yourself, that ... that I
      can&rsquo;t go on coming to see you any more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, sir,&rsquo; Praskovia Ivanovna repeated slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I assure you I greatly regret it; I confess it is positively painful to
      me, genuinely painful ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know best, sir,&rsquo; Praskovia Ivanovna rejoined serenely. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s for you
      to decide, sir. And, oh, if you&rsquo;ll allow me, I&rsquo;ll give you your little
      account, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov had not at all anticipated such a prompt acquiescence. He had
      not desired acquiescence at all; he had only wanted to frighten Praskovia
      Ivanovna, and above all Vassilissa. He felt wretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;this will not be disagreeable to Vassilissa; on the
      contrary, I believe she will be glad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Praskovia Ivanovna got out her reckoning beads, and began rattling the
      counters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the other hand,&rsquo; continued Pyetushkov, growing more and more agitated,
      &lsquo;if Vassilissa were, for instance, to give an explanation of her behaviour
      ... possibly.... Though, of course ... I don&rsquo;t know, possibly, I might
      perceive that after all there was no great matter for blame in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s thirty-seven roubles and forty kopecks in notes to your account,
      sir,&rsquo; observed Praskovia Ivanovna. &lsquo;Here, would you be pleased to go
      through it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eighteen dinners at seventy kopecks each; twelve roubles sixty kopecks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so we are to part, Praskovia Ivanovna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If so it must be, sir. Things do turn out so. Twelve samovars at ten
      kopecks each ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you might just tell me, Praskovia Ivanovna, where it was Vassilissa
      went, and what it was she ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I never asked her, sir.... One rouble twenty kopecks in silver.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch sank into meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kvas and effervescing drinks,&rsquo; pursued Praskovia Ivanovna, holding the
      counters apart on the frame not with her first, but her third finger,
      &lsquo;half a rouble in silver. Sugar and rolls for tea, half a rouble. Four
      packets of tobacco bought by your orders, eighty kopecks in silver. To the
      tailor Kuprian Apollonov ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch suddenly raised his head, put out his hand and mixed up
      the counters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you about, my good man?&rsquo; cried Praskovia Ivanovna. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      trust me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Praskovia Ivanovna,&rsquo; replied Pyetushkov, with a hurried smile, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      thought better of it. I was only, you know ... joking. We&rsquo;d better remain
      friends and go on in the old way. What nonsense it is! How can we separate&mdash;tell
      me that, please?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Praskovia Ivanovna looked down and made him no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, we&rsquo;ve been talking nonsense, and there&rsquo;s an end of it,&rsquo; pursued
      Ivan Afanasiitch, walking up and down the room, rubbing his hands, and, as
      it were, resuming his ancient rights. &lsquo;Amen! and now I&rsquo;d better have a
      pipe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Praskovia Ivanovna still did not move from her place....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see you are angry with me,&rsquo; said Pyetushkov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve offended you, perhaps. Well! well! forgive me generously.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How could you offend me, my good sir? No offence about it.... Only,
      please, sir,&rsquo; added Praskovia Ivanovna, bowing, &lsquo;be so good as not to go
      on coming to us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not for you, sir, to be friends with us, your honour. So, please, do
      us the favour ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Praskovia Ivanovna went on bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What ever for?&rsquo; muttered the astounded Pyetushkov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nothing, sir. For mercy&rsquo;s sake ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Praskovia Ivanovna, you must explain this! ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vassilissa asks you. She says, &ldquo;I thank you, thank you very much, and
      from my heart; only for the future, your honour, give us up.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Praskovia Ivanovna bowed down almost to Pyetushkov&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vassilissa, you say, begs me not to come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so, your honour. When your honour came in to-day, and said what you
      did, that you didn&rsquo;t wish, you said, to visit us any more, I felt
      relieved, sir, that I did; thinks I, Well, thank God, how nicely it&rsquo;s all
      come about! But for that, I should have had hard work to bring my tongue
      to say it.... Be so good, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov turned red and pale almost at the same instant. Praskovia
      Ivanovna still went on bowing....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; Ivan Afanasiitch cried sharply. &lsquo;Good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned abruptly and put on his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the little bill, sir....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send it ... my orderly shall pay you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov went with resolute steps out of the baker&rsquo;s shop, and did not
      even look round.

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>
      A fortnight passed. At first Pyetushkov bore up in an extraordinary way.
      He went out, and visited his comrades, with the exception, of course, of
      Bublitsyn; but in spite of the exaggerated approbation of Onisim, he
      almost went out of his mind at last from wretchedness, jealousy, and
      ennui. Conversations with Onisim about Vassilissa were the only thing that
      afforded him some consolation. The conversation was always begun,
      &lsquo;scratched up,&rsquo; by Pyetushkov; Onisim responded unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a strange thing, you know,&rsquo; Ivan Afanasiitch would say, for
      instance, as he lay on the sofa, while Onisim stood in his usual attitude,
      leaning against the door, with his hands folded behind his back, &lsquo;when you
      come to think of it, what it was I saw in that girl. One would say that
      there was nothing unusual in her. It&rsquo;s true she has a good heart. That one
      can&rsquo;t deny her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good heart, indeed!&rsquo; Onisim would answer with displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, now, Onisim,&rsquo; Pyetushkov went on, &lsquo;one must tell the truth. It&rsquo;s a
      thing of the past now; it&rsquo;s no matter to me now, but justice is justice.
      You don&rsquo;t know her. She&rsquo;s very good-hearted. Not a single beggar does she
      let pass by; she&rsquo;ll always give, if it&rsquo;s only a crust of bread. Oh! And
      she&rsquo;s of a cheerful temper, that one must allow, too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a notion! I don&rsquo;t know where you see the cheerful temper!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you ... you don&rsquo;t know her. And she&rsquo;s not mercenary either ...
      that&rsquo;s another thing. She&rsquo;s not grasping, there&rsquo;s no doubt of it. Why I
      never gave her anything, as you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s flung you over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that&rsquo;s not why!&rsquo; responded Pyetushkov with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;re in love with her to this day,&rsquo; Onisim retorted malignantly.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d be glad to go back there as before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense you&rsquo;re talking. No, my lad, you don&rsquo;t know me either, I
      can see. Be sent away, and then go dancing attendance&mdash;no, thank you,
      I&rsquo;d rather be excused. No, I tell you. You may believe me, it&rsquo;s all a
      thing of the past now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray God it be so!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why ever shouldn&rsquo;t I be fair to her, now after all? If now I say
      she&rsquo;s not good-looking&mdash;why, who&rsquo;d believe me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A queer sort of good looks!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, find me,&mdash;well, mention anybody better-looking ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;d better go back to her, then! ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stupid! Do you suppose that&rsquo;s why I say so? Understand me ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I understand you,&rsquo; Onisim answered with a heavy sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another week passed by. Pyetushkov had positively given up talking with
      his Onisim, and had given up going out. From morning till night he lay on
      the sofa, his hands behind his head. He began to get thin and pale, eat
      unwillingly and hurriedly, and did not smoke at all. Onisim could only
      shake his head, as he looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not well, Ivan Afanasiitch,&rsquo; he said to him more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m all right,&rsquo; replied Pyetushkov.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, one fine day (Onisim was not at home) Pyetushkov got up, rummaged
      in his chest of drawers, put on his cloak, though the sun was rather hot,
      went stealthily out into the street, and came back a quarter of an hour
      later.... He carried something under his cloak....
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim was not at home. The whole morning he had been sitting in his
      little room, deliberating with himself, grumbling and swearing between his
      teeth, and, at last, he sallied off to Vassilissa. He found her in the
      shop. Praskovia Ivanovna was asleep on the stove, rhythmically and
      soothingly snoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, how d&rsquo;ye do, Onisim Sergeitch,&rsquo; began Vassilissa, with a smile; &lsquo;why
      haven&rsquo;t we seen anything of you for so long?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why are you so depressed? Would you like a cup of tea?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not me we&rsquo;re talking about now,&rsquo; rejoined Onisim, in a tone of
      vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! Don&rsquo;t you understand me? What! What have you done to my master,
      come, you tell me that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I&rsquo;ve done to him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you done to him? ... You go and look at him. Why, before we can
      look round, he&rsquo;ll be in a decline, or dying outright, maybe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault, Onisim Sergeitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not your fault! God knows. Why, he&rsquo;s lost his heart to you. And you, God
      forgive you, treated him as if he were one of yourselves. Don&rsquo;t come, says
      you, I&rsquo;m sick of you. Why, though he&rsquo;s not much to boast of, he&rsquo;s a
      gentleman anyway. He&rsquo;s a gentleman born, you know.... Do you realise
      that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But he&rsquo;s such a dull person, Onisim Sergeitch....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dull! So you must have merry fellows about you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it&rsquo;s not so much that he&rsquo;s dull: he&rsquo;s so cross, so jealous.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you, you&rsquo;re as haughty as a princess! He was in your way, I dare
      say!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you yourself, Onisim Sergeitch, if you remember, were put out with
      him about it; &ldquo;Why is he such friends?&rdquo; you said; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s he always coming
      for?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, was I to be pleased with him for it, do you suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, why are you angry with me now? Here, he&rsquo;s given up coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim positively stamped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what am I to do with him, if he&rsquo;s such a madman?&rsquo; he added, dropping
      his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how am I in fault? What can I do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what: come with me to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God forbid!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why won&rsquo;t you come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why should I go to see him? Upon my word!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why? Why, because he says you&rsquo;ve a good heart; let me see if you&rsquo;ve a
      good heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what good can I do him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s my business. You may be sure things are in a bad way, since
      I&rsquo;ve come to you. It&rsquo;s certain I could think of nothing else to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim paused for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, come along, Vassilissa, please, come along.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Onisim Sergeitch, I don&rsquo;t want to be friendly with him again ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and you needn&rsquo;t&mdash;who&rsquo;s talking of it? You&rsquo;ve only to say a
      couple of words; to say, Why does your honour grieve? ... give over....
      That&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really, Onisim Sergeitch ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, am I to go down on my knees to you, eh? All right&mdash;there, I&rsquo;m
      on my knees ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But really ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what a girl it is! Even that doesn&rsquo;t touch her! ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa at last consented, put a kerchief on her head, and went out
      with Onisim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wait here a little, in the passage,&rsquo; he said to her, when they
      reached Pyetushkov&rsquo;s abode, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll go and let the master know ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in to Ivan Afanasiitch. Pyetushkov was standing in the middle of
      the room, both hands in his pockets, his legs excessively wide apart; he
      was slightly swaying backwards and forwards. His face was hot, and his
      eyes were sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hullo, Onisim,&rsquo; he faltered amiably, articulating the consonants very
      indistinctly and thickly: &lsquo;hullo, my lad. Ah, my lad, when you weren&rsquo;t
      here ... he, he, he ...&rsquo; Pyetushkov laughed and made a sudden duck forward
      with his nose. &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s an accomplished fact, he, he, he.... However,&rsquo; 
      he added, trying to assume a dignified air, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m all right.&rsquo; He tried to
      lift his foot, but almost fell over, and to preserve his dignity
      pronounced in a deep bass, &lsquo;Boy, bring my pipe!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Onisim gazed in astonishment at his master, glanced round.... In the
      window stood an empty dark-green bottle, with the inscription: &lsquo;Best
      Jamaica rum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been drinking, my lad, that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; Pyetushkov went on. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      and taken it. I&rsquo;ve been drinking, and that&rsquo;s all about it. And where&rsquo;ve
      you been? Tell us ... don&rsquo;t be shy ... tell us. You&rsquo;re a good hand at a
      tale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ivan Afanasiitch, mercy on us!&rsquo; wailed Onisim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure. To be sure I will,&rsquo; replied Pyetushkov with a vague wave of
      his hand. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have mercy on you, and forgive you. I forgive every one, I
      forgive you, and Vassilissa I forgive, and every one, every one. Yes, my
      lad, I&rsquo;ve been drinking.... Dri-ink-ing, lad.... Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; he cried
      suddenly, pointing to the door into the passage; &lsquo;who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody&rsquo;s there,&rsquo; Onisim answered hastily: &lsquo;who should be there? ... where
      are you going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; repeated Pyetushkov, breaking away from Onisim, &lsquo;let me go, I
      saw&mdash;don&rsquo;t you talk to me,&mdash;I saw there, let me go....
      Vassilissa!&rsquo; he shrieked all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well ... well, why don&rsquo;t you come in?&rsquo; he said at last. &lsquo;Come in,
      Vassilissa, come in. I&rsquo;m very glad to see you, Vassilissa.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa glanced at Onisim and came into the room. Pyetushkov went
      nearer to her.... He heaved deep, irregular breaths. Onisim watched him.
      Vassilissa stole timid glances at both of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down, Vassilissa,&rsquo; Ivan Afanasiitch began again: &lsquo;thanks for coming.
      Excuse my being ... what shall I say? ... not quite fit to be seen. I
      couldn&rsquo;t foresee, couldn&rsquo;t really, you&rsquo;ll own that yourself. Come, sit
      down, see here, on the sofa ... So ... I&rsquo;m expressing myself all right, I
      think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, good day to you,&rsquo; Ivan Afanasiitch pursued. &lsquo;Come, how are you?
      what have you been doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m well, thank God, Ivan Afanasiitch. And you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I? as you see! A ruined man. And ruined by whom? By you, Vassilissa. But
      I&rsquo;m not angry with you. Only I&rsquo;m a ruined man. You ask him. (He pointed to
      Onisim.) Don&rsquo;t you mind my being drunk. I&rsquo;m drunk, certainly; only I&rsquo;m a
      ruined man. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m drunk, because I&rsquo;m a ruined man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord have mercy on us, Ivan Afanasiitch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A ruined man, Vassilissa, I tell you. You may believe me. I&rsquo;ve never
      deceived you. Oh, and how&rsquo;s your aunt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, Ivan Afanasiitch. Thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pyetushkov began swaying violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you&rsquo;re not quite well to-day, Ivan Afanasiitch. You ought to lie
      down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m quite well, Vassilissa. No, don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m not well; you&rsquo;d better
      say I&rsquo;ve fallen into evil ways, lost my morals. That&rsquo;s what would be just.
      I won&rsquo;t dispute that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch gave a lurch backwards. Onisim ran forward and held his
      master up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who&rsquo;s to blame for it? I&rsquo;ll tell you, if you like, who&rsquo;s to blame.
      I&rsquo;m to blame, in the first place. What ought I to have said? I ought to
      have said to you: Vassilissa, I love you. Good&mdash;well, will you marry
      me? Will you? It&rsquo;s true you&rsquo;re a working girl, granted; but that&rsquo;s all
      right. It&rsquo;s done sometimes. Why, there, I knew a fellow, he got married
      like that. Married a Finnish servant-girl. Took and married her. And you&rsquo;d
      have been happy with me. I&rsquo;m a good-natured chap, I am! Never you mind my
      being drunk, you look at my heart. There, you ask this ... fellow. So, you
      see, I turn out to be in fault. And now, of course, I&rsquo;m a ruined man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivan Afanasiitch was more and more in need of Onisim&rsquo;s support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All the same, you did wrong, very wrong. I loved you, I respected you ...
      what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;m ready to go to church with you this minute. Will you?
      You&rsquo;ve only to say the word, and we&rsquo;ll start at once. Only you wounded me
      cruelly ... cruelly. You might at least have turned me away yourself&mdash;but
      through your aunt, through that fat female! Why, the only joy I had in
      life was you. I&rsquo;m a homeless man, you know, a poor lonely creature! Who is
      there now to be kind to me? who says a kind word to me? I&rsquo;m utterly alone.
      Stript bare as a crow. You ask this ...&rsquo; Ivan Afanasiitch began to cry.
      &lsquo;Vassilissa, listen what I say to you,&rsquo; he went on: &lsquo;let me come and see
      you as before. Don&rsquo;t be afraid.... I&rsquo;ll be ... quiet as a mouse. You can
      go and see whom you like, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;be all right: not a word, no
      protests, you know. Eh? do you agree? If you like, I&rsquo;ll go down on my
      knees.&rsquo; (And Ivan Afanasiitch bent his knees, but Onisim held him up under
      the arms.) &lsquo;Let me go! It&rsquo;s not your business! It&rsquo;s a matter of the
      happiness of a whole life, don&rsquo;t you understand, and you hinder....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassilissa did not know what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t ... Well, as you will! God be with you. In that case, good-bye!
      Good-bye, Vassilissa. I wish you all happiness and prosperity ... but I
      ... but I ...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Pyetushkov sobbed violently. Onisim with all his might held him up
      from behind ... first his face worked, then he burst out crying. And
      Vassilissa cried too.

    <p>
      Ten years later, one might have met in the streets of the little town of O&mdash;&mdash;
      a thinnish man with a reddish nose, dressed in an old green coat with a
      greasy plush collar. He occupied a small garret in the baker&rsquo;s shop, with
      which we are familiar. Praskovia Ivanovna was no longer of this world. The
      business was carried on by her niece, Vassilissa, and her husband, the
      red-haired, dim-eyed baker, Demofont. The man in the green coat had one
      weakness: he was over fond of drink. He was, however, always quiet when he
      was tipsy. The reader has probably recognised him as Ivan Afanasiitch.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
